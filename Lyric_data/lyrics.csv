Rush,Cygnus X 1 Book II Hemispheres,"[i. prelude] when our weary world was young the struggle of the ancients first began. the gods of love and reason sought alone to rule the fate of man. they battled through the ages, but still neither force would yield. the people were divided, every soul a battlefield. [ii. apollo: bringer of wisdom] ""i bring truth and understanding, i bring wit and wisdom fair, precious gifts beyond compare. we can build a world of wonder, i can make you all aware. i will find you food and shelter, show you fire to keep you warm through the endless winter storm. you can live in grace and comfort in the world that you transform."" the people were delighted coming forth to claim their prize they ran to build their cities and converse among the wise. but one day the streets fell silent, yet they knew not what was wrong. the urge to build these fine things seemed not to be so strong. the wise men were consulted, and the bridge of death was crossed in quest of dionysus, to find out what they had lost. [iii. dionysus: bringer of love] ""i bring love to give you solace in the darkness of the night, in the heart's eternal light. you need only trust your feelings; only love can steer you right. i bring laughter, i bring music, i bring joy and i bring tears. i will soothe your primal fears. throw off those chains of reason and your prison disappears."" the cities were abandoned, and the forests echoed song. they danced and lived as brothers; they knew love could not be wrong. food and wine they had aplenty and they slept beneath the stars. the people were contented and the gods watched from afar. but the winter fell upon them and it caught them unprepared, bringing wolves and cold starvation, and the hearts of men despaired. [iv. armageddon: the battle of heart and mind] the universe divided as the heart and mind collided, with the people left unguided for so many troubled years. in a cloud of doubts and fears, their world was torn asunder into hollow hemispheres. some fought themselves, some fought each other. most just followed one another, lost and aimless like their brothers, for their hearts were so unclear, and the truth could not appear. their spirits were divided into blinded hemispheres. some who did not fight brought tales of old to light. my rocinante' sailed by night on her final flight. to the heart of cygnus' fearsome force we set our course. spiralled through that timeless space to this immortal place. [v. cygnus: bringer of balance] i have memory and awareness, but i have no shape or form. as a disembodied spirit, i am dead and yet unborn. i have passed into olympus as was told in tales of old, to the city of immortals, marble white and purest gold. i see the gods in battle rage on high thunderbolts across the sky. i cannot move, i cannot hide, i feel a silent scream begin inside. then all at once the chaos ceased. a stillness fell, a sudden peace. the warriors felt my silent cry and stayed their struggle, mystified. apollo was astonished; dionysus thought me mad. but they heard my story further, and they wondered, and were sad. looking down from olympus on a world of doubt and fear, its surface splintered into sorry hemispheres. they sat a while in silence, then they turned at last to me. ""we will call you cygnus, the god of balance you shall be."" [vi. the sphere: a kind of dream] we can walk our road together if our goals are all the same. we can run alone and free if we pursue a different aim. let the truth of love be lighted, let the love of truth shine clear. sensibility, armed with sense and liberty, with the heart and mind united in a single perfect sphere.",rock,656,22.230437461491064

man, my bar mitzvah money but do not diss me buddy i was not one of them youngins up on the block who had nothing to lose i must have wanted this a lot, i had something to choose look at that, i can say there is something to prove up in your ass yeah, i guess that is enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap?

little gay-lookin' boy so gay i can barely say it with a straight face lookin' boy (ha-ha!) you are witnessin' a massacre like you are watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy ""oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that is all they say, lookin' boy you get a thumbs up, pat on the back and a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy hey, lookin' boy! what you say, lookin' boy? i get a ""hell yeah"" from dre, lookin' boy i'ma work for everything i have never asked nobody for shit get outta my face, lookin' boy! basically, boy, you are never going to be capable of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, because— the way i am racin' around the track call me nascar, nascar dale earnhardt of the trailer park, the white trash god kneel before general zod this planet's krypton—no, asgard, asgard so you will be thor, i will be odin you rodent, i am omnipotent let off, then i am reloadin' immediately with these bombs, i am totin' and i should not be woken i am the walkin' dead, but i am just a talkin' head a zombie floatin' but i got your mom deep-throatin' i am out my ramen noodle we have nothing in common, poodle i am a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil it is me, my honesty's brutal but it is honestly futile if i do not utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i want to make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i got to keep a few punchlines just in case, because even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it is lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i am on my pharoah monch grind so i crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on ""i am back"" from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say i will take seven kids from columbine put  them all in a line, add an ak-47, a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i are not as big as i was, but i am morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal you are stuck in a time warp from 2004 though and i do not know what the fuck that you rhyme for you are pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows you write normal?

innovative and i am made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it will glue to you and i am devastating, more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it is levitating never fading, and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off, they will be celebrating because i know the way to get  them motivated i make elevating music, you make elevator music ""oh, he is too mainstream."" well, that is what they do when they get jealous they confuse it ""it is not hip-hop, it is pop,""—because i found a hella way to fuse it with rock, shock rap with doc throw on ""lose yourself"" and make  them lose it ""i do not know how to make songs like that i do not know what words to use."" let me know when it occurs to you while i am rippin' any one of these s that versus you it is curtains, i am inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i got to murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?

make lemonade then! but if i can not batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then? do not mistake him for satan; it is a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and do not be a retard — be a king?

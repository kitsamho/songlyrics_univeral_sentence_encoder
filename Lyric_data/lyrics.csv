Rush,Cygnus X 1 Book II Hemispheres,"[i. prelude] when our weary world was young the struggle of the ancients first began. the gods of love and reason sought alone to rule the fate of man. they battled through the ages, but still neither force would yield. the people were divided, every soul a battlefield. [ii. apollo: bringer of wisdom] ""i bring truth and understanding, i bring wit and wisdom fair, precious gifts beyond compare. we can build a world of wonder, i can make you all aware. i will find you food and shelter, show you fire to keep you warm through the endless winter storm. you can live in grace and comfort in the world that you transform."" the people were delighted coming forth to claim their prize they ran to build their cities and converse among the wise. but one day the streets fell silent, yet they knew not what was wrong. the urge to build these fine things seemed not to be so strong. the wise men were consulted, and the bridge of death was crossed in quest of dionysus, to find out what they had lost. [iii. dionysus: bringer of love] ""i bring love to give you solace in the darkness of the night, in the heart's eternal light. you need only trust your feelings; only love can steer you right. i bring laughter, i bring music, i bring joy and i bring tears. i will soothe your primal fears. throw off those chains of reason and your prison disappears."" the cities were abandoned, and the forests echoed song. they danced and lived as brothers; they knew love could not be wrong. food and wine they had aplenty and they slept beneath the stars. the people were contented and the gods watched from afar. but the winter fell upon them and it caught them unprepared, bringing wolves and cold starvation, and the hearts of men despaired. [iv. armageddon: the battle of heart and mind] the universe divided as the heart and mind collided, with the people left unguided for so many troubled years. in a cloud of doubts and fears, their world was torn asunder into hollow hemispheres. some fought themselves, some fought each other. most just followed one another, lost and aimless like their brothers, for their hearts were so unclear, and the truth could not appear. their spirits were divided into blinded hemispheres. some who did not fight brought tales of old to light. my rocinante' sailed by night on her final flight. to the heart of cygnus' fearsome force we set our course. spiralled through that timeless space to this immortal place. [v. cygnus: bringer of balance] i have memory and awareness, but i have no shape or form. as a disembodied spirit, i am dead and yet unborn. i have passed into olympus as was told in tales of old, to the city of immortals, marble white and purest gold. i see the gods in battle rage on high thunderbolts across the sky. i cannot move, i cannot hide, i feel a silent scream begin inside. then all at once the chaos ceased. a stillness fell, a sudden peace. the warriors felt my silent cry and stayed their struggle, mystified. apollo was astonished; dionysus thought me mad. but they heard my story further, and they wondered, and were sad. looking down from olympus on a world of doubt and fear, its surface splintered into sorry hemispheres. they sat a while in silence, then they turned at last to me. ""we will call you cygnus, the god of balance you shall be."" [vi. the sphere: a kind of dream] we can walk our road together if our goals are all the same. we can run alone and free if we pursue a different aim. let the truth of love be lighted, let the love of truth shine clear. sensibility, armed with sense and liberty, with the heart and mind united in a single perfect sphere.",rock,656,22.230437461491064

man, my bar mitzvah money but do not diss me buddy i was not one of them youngins up on the block who had nothing to lose i must have wanted this a lot, i had something to choose look at that, i can say there is something to prove up in your ass yeah, i guess that is enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap? oh my god, it is the best bitches let me draw up on their breasts literally i can reinvent myself i got a forum to project myself it is never boring, every morning i wake up and try to best myself i never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself it is kinda healthy cool, now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals sure in a club and a couple niggas threaten you uh, i would not do shit and i do not even get what that got to do with this? shut the fuck up, rap's like life if you want to do this, then you will not get far acting like a little bitch nah, that is my niche! do not get offended by this, but that is the market you all missed that is the target i will hit and that is the heart of my pitch i want to do this whole thing different what the fuck you mean you want to do the whole thing different? uh, you know, i-i think, like, you know traditionally people have been doing the job, uh, you know the same kind of way for a long time but traditionally speaking, this shit works, right? nah, like, i get that, but i-i just think that, you know you do not know if it could be working even better and i think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out i do not mean any disrespect by that i am just saying i have a different background like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant so what are your biggest strengths? well my flow is crazy, i can switch that amazing for example, i can be like are not nobody fucking with lil dicky when he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous ripping this shit like it is never been did and the rhythm is never predictable because i can switch it, deliver this shit to whatever cadence you bitches prefer alright, alright, i get it top of that, lyrically i am pretty damn clever (go) got a long bottom bitch, called a hoe neville (whoa) and i blow it from the jump, derrick rose knee (oh) you can say i am pretty smart how i know better and you all been winning like pistorius it is no feat bro, i can go on and on i am taking over any man like father-in-laws okay enough of the punchlines that are not showing me you different from the other guys well, i do not know if they can run it like that but are not nobody else doing funny type rap what is that?

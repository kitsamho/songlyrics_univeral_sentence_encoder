you can call me dogg let me just check your sheet no problem, sir, let me just say i'm a big fan of the shit that y'all make i can't lie, i been thinking about this all day all good, there's a reason that we called, dave let me start with your background where you come from? sure, i was undergrad down there in richmond before that oh, you talking 'bout my hometown? yeah i was born out of philly grew up in a little silly old town called cheltenham it's in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around so real shit you ain't never had to struggle for much i wouldn't say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap elaborate well i ain't never had a tool, but i had to be the man at school like i was doing shit i had to do so when i finished undergrad, i'm cool and i can get whatever job i wanted but the job you wanted wasn't all that bumping yeah, and i saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that know you been racing them rats, you ain't been making them raps boo hoo what a hardship how you paid to get the rap shit started? man, my bar mitzvah money but don't diss me buddy i wasn't one of them youngins up on the block who had nothing to lose i must've wanted this a lot, i had something to choose look at that, i can say there's something to prove up in your ass yeah, i guess that's enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap? oh my god, it's the best bitches let me draw up on their breasts literally i can reinvent myself i got a forum to project myself it's never boring, every morning i wake up and try to best myself i never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself it's kinda healthy cool, now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals sure in a club and a couple niggas threaten you uh, i wouldn't do shit and i don't even get what that got to do with this? shut the fuck up, rap's like life if you wanna do this, then you won't get far acting like a little bitch nah, that's my niche! don't get offended by this, but that's the market y'all missed that's the target i'll hit and that's the heart of my pitch i wanna do this whole thing different what the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different? uh, you know, i-i think, like, you know traditionally people have been doing the job, uh, you know the same kind of way for a long time but traditionally speaking, this shit works, right? nah, like, i get that, but i-i just think that, you know you don't know if it could be working even better and i think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out i don't mean any disrespect by that i'm just saying i have a different background like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant so what are your biggest strengths? well my flow is crazy, i can switch that amazing for example, i can be like ain't nobody fucking with lil dicky when he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous ripping this shit like it's never been did and the rhythm is never predictable 'cause i can switch it, deliver this shit to whatever cadence you bitches prefer alright, alright, i get it top of that, lyrically i'm pretty damn clever (go) got a long bottom bitch, called a hoe neville (whoa) and i blow it from the jump, derrick rose knee (oh) you can say i'm pretty smart how i know better and y'all been winning like pistorius it's no feat bro, i can go on and on i'm taking over any man like father-in-laws okay enough of the punchlines that ain't showing me you different from the other guys well, i don't know if they can run it like that but ain't nobody else doing funny type rap what's that? well i can tell a story about my morning watching boy meets world and jerking off to topanga lawrence like the 14 year old topanga oh this shit like a joke to you? i don't get it nah it ain't like that i just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual like as a guy so when i get up on the mic i ain't finna just lie real recognize real, right? so what you trying to do? five years from now, tell me bout the dude well, i don't care about the money like, it's the respect that i'm wanting honestly, i just want to be one of the greats where they gotta bring your boy up every debate i don't wanna leave the game the same in a nutshell, what's your legacy? well, i wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand up rap with the random rap and the man like that for the people that was anti-rap yet, the fans of rap started recognizing that anti-rap is ironically one of the real brands of rap left that shit sound pretty damn complex i guess, i wanna be the best i just wanna do it my way and turn the whole game sideways and show people you ain't gotta be resigned to the highway you can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight i ain't mad at that well thanks, man, that's my plan of my attack just let me in and i'ma rap the plaques and i ain't about to win them back to back i'm 'bout to win them like it's back to back to back to back to back 'til i stop rapping you ain't even sold a damn album yet true that's a lot of talk from a wily vet let alone a young rook nigga you misread me nah this ain't a book nigga well that's one of my flaws, i'm too competitive dawg no, you just fucking repetitive dawg i get it, you trying to be better than all but you ain't shit until cheddars involved i get that i gotta prove myself no shit you ain't done shit think about that though only doing this a couple of years one tape and i'm like this?

For this is no time for depression or self-indulgent hesitance This fucked-up situation calls for all hands, hands on deck Freedom is as freedom does and freedom is a verb They giveth they taketh and you fight to keep that what you've earned We saw the destination, got so close before it turned Swim sideways from this undertow And do not be deterred Floodlight dreams go drifting past All the lives we could've had Distant loves floating above Close these eyes, they've seen enough Caught the butterfly, broke its wings then put it on display Stripped of all its beauty once it could not fly high away Still alive like a passer-by overdosed on gamma rays Another God's creation destined to be thrown away Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, they forged the north and west Then there's Sitting Bullshit as our sitting president Talking to his mirror, what's he say, what's it say back? A tragedy of errors, who'll be the last to have a laugh? His best days gone, hard to admit Throwing angry punches with nothing to hit Luminous thoughts were once all he had Fading lights, lost eloquence There's still a fire in the engine room Knows relief will be coming soon What's to be done Carve a path for rivers reign Much to be done Oceans rising with the waves So, held by these thoughts They refuse to slip away Oh, hangman in dreamland About to call your name Much to be"

All the complexities and games No one wins but somehow they're still played All the missing crooked hearts They may die but in us they live on When hurricanes and cyclones raged When winds turned dirt to dust When floods they came or tides they raised Ever closer became us All the promises at sundown I've meant them like the rest All the demons used to come round I'm grateful now they've left So persistent in my ways Hey Angel I am here to stay No resistance, no alarms Please, this is just too good to be gone You and me"

Iron Maiden,The Trooper 2015 Remaster,"You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through So when you're waiting for the next attack You'd better stand, there's no turning back The bugle sounds, the charge begins But on this battlefield, no one wins The smell of acrid smoke and horses' breath As I plunge on into certain death The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run The mighty roar of the Russian guns And as we race towards the human wall The screams of pain as my comrades fall We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground And the Russians fire another round We get so near, yet so far away We won't live to fight another day We get so close, near enough to fight When a Russian gets me in his sights He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow A burst of rounds take my horse below And as I lay there gazing at the sky My body's numb and my throat is dry And as I lay forgotten and alone Without a tear, I draw my parting groan"
Iron Maiden,Dance of Death,"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones Out of things that I saw One night wandering in the everglades I'd one drink but no more I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight Gazing up at the stars Not aware of a presence so near to me Watching my every move Feeling scared and I fell to my knees As something rushed me from the trees Took me to an unholy place And that is where I fell from grace Then they summoned me over to join in with them To the dance of the dead Into the circle of fire I followed them Into the middle I was led As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear But still I wanted to go And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me As I walked onto the coals And I felt I was in a trance And my spirit was lifted from me And if only someone had the chance To witness what happened to me And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them All had death in their eyes Lifeless figures, they were undead all of them They had ascended from hell As I danced with the dead My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me Below my undead body just danced the circle of dead Until the time came to reunite us both My spirit came back down to me I didn't know if I was alive or dead As the others all joined in with me By luck then a skirmish started And took the attention away from me When they took their gaze from me Was the moment that I fled I ran like hell faster than the wind But behind I did not glance One thing that I did not dare Was to look just straight ahead When you know that your time has come around You know you'll be prepared for it Say your last goodbyes to everyone Drink and say a prayer for it When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead To this day I guess I'll never know Just why they let me go But I'll never go dancing no more 'Til I dance with the dead"

Black Sabbath,Electric Funeral,"Reflex in the sky Warn you you're gonna die Storm coming, you better hide From the atomic tide Flashes in the sky Turns houses into sties Turns people into clay Radiation minds decay Robot minds of robot slaves Lead them to atomic graves Plastic flowers melting sun Fading moon falls upon Dying world of radiation Victims of man's frustration Burning globe of obscene fire Like electric funeral pyre Buildings crashing down To Earth's cracking ground Rivers turn to wood Ice melt into blood Earth lies in death bed Clouds cry for the dead Terrifying rain Is a burning pain Electric funeral And so in the sky Shines the electric eye Supernatural king Takes Earth under his wing Heaven's golden chorus sings Hell's angels flap their wings Evil souls fall to Hell Ever trapped in burning cells"

Black Sabbath,A National Acrobat,"I am the world that hides The universal secret of all time Destruction of the empty spaces Is my one and only crime I've lived a thousand times I found out what it means to be believed The thoughts and images The unborn child that never was conceived When little worlds collide I'm trapped inside my embryonic cell And flashing memories Are cast into the never-ending well The name that scorns the face The child that never sees the cause of man The deathly darkness that Belies the fate of those who never ran You gotta believe, yeah I'm talking to you Well, I know it's hard for you To know the reason why And I know you'll understand More when it's time to die Don't believe the life you have Will be the only one You have to let your body sleep To let your soul live on I want you to listen I'm trying to get through Love has given life to you And now it's your concern Unseen eye of inner life Will make your soul return Still, I look, but not to touch The seeds of life are sown Curtain of the future falls The secret stays unknown Just remember love is life And hate is living death Treat your life for what it's worth And live for every breath Looking back I've lived and learned But, now, I'm wondering Here, I wait and only guess What this next life will bring, haha!"

Black Sabbath,After Forever,"Have you ever though about your soul can it be saved Or perhaps you think that when you're dead You just stay in your grave Is God just a thought within your head Or is he a part of you? Is Christ just a name that you read in a book When you were at school? When you think about death do you lose your breath Or do you keep your cool? Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope Do you think he's a fool? Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light And I've changed my ways And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared At the end of our days Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say If they knew you believe in God above? They should realize before they criticize That God is the only way to love Is your mind so small that you have to fall In with the pack wherever they run Will you still sneer when death is near And say they may as well worship the sun? I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe? You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone Open your eyes Just realize that he's the one The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate Or will you still jeer at all you hear? Yes! I think it's too late."
Black Sabbath,Changes,"I feel unhappy I feel so sad I've lost the best friend That I ever had She was my woman I love her so But it's too late now I've let her go I'm going through changes We shared the years We shared each day In love, together We found the way But soon, the world Had its evil way My heart was blinded Love went astray It took so long To realize And I can still hear Her last goodbyes Now, all my days Are filled with tears Wish I could go back And change these years"
Black Sabbath,Snowblind,"What you get, and what you see Things that don't come easily Feeling happy in my pain Icicles within my brain (Cocaine) Something blowin' in my head Winds of ice that soon will spread Down to freeze my very soul Makes me happy, makes me cold My eyes are blind, but I can see The snowflakes glisten on the trees The Sun no longer sets me free I feel the snowflakes freezing me Let the winter sun shine on Let me feel the frost of dawn Fill my dreams with flakes of snow Soon I'll feel the chilling glow Don't you think I know what I'm doing Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong You're the one that's really the loser This is where I feel I belong Kiss the world with winter flowers Turn my days to frozen hours Lying snowblind in the sun Will my ice age ever come?"
Black Sabbath,Walk Away,"Lord, she's handsome as she flows across the floor Nothing I've seen in my life has ever pleased me more She's got the look of freedom and it makes you think she's wild But I can see right through it all, it's a way to have a child Oh, walk away She's looking to love you There's nothing to say Just turn your head and walk away (Hoho, ho hoho) (Hoho) Walk away, walk on (Hoho, ho hoho) She moves in sunlight, never seen the night at all Like a star in the midnight sky, burns before it falls I've never been lonely and I can't imagine why Maybe she can be the one to tell me, I guess it's do or die Can't see her fire But I can feel her heat, all right It's rising higher I'm walking the wire Ho ho Walk on by Oh walk on by, walk away (Hoho, ho hoho) Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk away (Hoho) Walk away (Hoho, ho hoho) (Hoho, ho hoho) You'll feel her fire (Hoho) She'll lift you higher (Ho hoho) But don't be fooled (Hoho) Just turn your head and walk away (Hoho) (Ho hoho) Walk away"
Black Sabbath,The Wizard,"Misty morning, clouds in the sky Without warning, the wizard walks by Casting his shadow, weaving his spell Funny clothes, tinkling bell Never talking Just keeps walking Spreading his magic Evil power disappears Demons worry when the wizard is near He turns tears into joy Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by Sun is shining, clouds have gone by All the people give a happy sigh He has passed by, giving his sign Left all the people feeling so fine Spreading his magic."
Black Sabbath,War Pigs,"Generals gathered in their masses Just like witches at black masses Evil minds that plot destruction Sorcerer of death's construction In the fields, the bodies burning As the war machine keeps turning Death and hatred to mankind Poisoning their brainwashed minds Oh lord, yeah! Politicians hide themselves away They only started the war Why should they go out to fight? They leave that role to the poor, yeah Time will tell on their power minds Making war just for fun Treating people just like pawns in chess Wait till their judgement day comes, yeah!

Black Sabbath,Lord of This World,You're searching for your mind don't know where to start Can't find the key to fit the lock on your heart You think you know but you are never quite sure Your soul is ill but you will not find a cure Your world was made for you by someone above But you chose evil ways instead of love You made me master of the world where you exist The soul I took from you was not even missed Lord of this world Evil possessor He's your confessor now! You think you're innocent you've nothing to fear You don't know me you say but isn't it clear? You turn to me in all your worldly greed and pride But will you turn to me when it's your turn to die?
Black Sabbath,Zeitgeist,Astral engines in reverse I'm falling through the universe again Down among a dead mans vision Faded dreams and nuclear fishions span The strings of fear they are holding up the race The puppets falling to the ground The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found On this sinking ship I travel Faster than the speed of life Not so super nova burns The black holes turn and fade from sight The strings of fear they hide within the human race The answers burried underground And very soon The boundless moon Will show us light And as we crash We'll pray and kiss And say goodnight Goodnight
Black Sabbath,Sabbra Cadabra,"Feel so good I feel so fine Love that little lady always on my mind She gives me lovin' every night and day Never gonna leave her, never going away Someone to love me You know she makes me feel alright Someone who needs me Love me every single night Feel so happy since I met that girl When we're making love it's something out of this world Feels so good to know that she's all mine Going to love that woman till the end of time Someone to live for Love me till the end of time Makes me feel happy Good to know that she's all mine Lovely lady make love all night long Lovely lady never do me wrong I don't wanna leave ya I never wanna leave ya Anymore, no more Lovely lady, mystifying eyes Lovely lady, she don't tell me no lies I know I'll never leave ya I'm never gonna leave ya Anymore, I said no more I said no more No more, yeah I said no more, no more I said no more, ooh yeah"
Black Sabbath,Am I Going Insane Radio,"Everybody's looking at me Feeling paranoid inside When I step outside I'll feel free Think I'll find a place to hide Tell me people, am I going insane? Every day I sit and wonder How my life it used to be Now I feel I'm going under Now my life is hard to see So tell me people, am I going insane? So I'm telling all you people Listen while I sing again If I don't sound very cheerful I think that I'm a schizophrene"
Black Sabbath,Children of the Grave,"Revolution in their minds The children start to march Against the world in which they have to live And all the hate that's in their hearts They're tired of being pushed around And told just what to do They'll fight the world until they've won And love comes flowing through Children of tomorrow live in The tears that fall today Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way? Must the world live in the shadow Of atomic fear? Can they win the fight for peace Or will they disappear? So you children of the world Listen to what I say If you want a better place to live in Spread the words today Show the world that love is still alive You must be brave Or you children of today are Children of the grave, Yeah!"
Black Sabbath,Warning,"Now the first day that I met you I was looking in the sky When the sun turned all a blur And the thunderclouds rolled by The sea began to shiver And the wind began to moan It must've been a sign for me To leave you well alone I was born without you, baby But my feelings were a little bit too strong You never said you love me And I don't believe you can 'Cause I saw you in a dream And you were with another man You looked so cool and casual And I tried to look the same But now, I've got to love you Tell me who am I to blame? Now the whole wide world is movin' 'Cause there's iron in my heart I just can't keep from cryin' 'Cause you say we've got to part Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone And watch you slowly take away A love I've never known Just a little bit too strong 'Cause say we've got to part"
Black Sabbath,Spiral Architect,"Sorcerers of madness Selling me their time Child of God sitting in the sun Keeping peace of mind Fictional seduction On a black snow sky Sadness kills the superman Even fathers cry Of all the things I value most of all I look inside myself And see my world And know that it is good You know that I should Superstitious centuries Didn't time go slow Separating sanity Watching children grow Synchronated undertaker Spiral skies Silver ships on plasmic oceans In disguise Of all the things I value most in life I see my memories And feel their warmth And know that they are good Watching eyes of celluloid Tell you how to live Metaphoric motories Say give, give, give Laughter giving, love is showing Me the way Spiral building architect I build, you pay I look upon my Earth And feel the warmth"
Black Sabbath,Behind the Wall of Sleep,"Precious cups within the flower Deadly petals with strange power Faces shine a deadly smile Look upon you at your trial Chill and numbs from head to toe Icy sun with frosty glow Words that go read to your sorrow Words that go read no tomorrow Feel your spirit rise with the breeze Feel your body falling onto it's knees Sleeping wall of remorse Take your body to a corpse Now from darkness, there springs light Wall of sleep is cool and bright Wall of sleep is lying broken Sun shines in, you have awoken"
Black Sabbath,Die Young,"Gather the wind Though the wind won't help you fly at all Your back's to the wall Chain the sun And it tears away to face you as you run You run, you run Behind the smile There's danger and a promise to be told You'll never get old, ha Life's fantasy To be locked away and still to think you're free You're free, we're free So live for today Tomorrow never comes Die young, die young Can't you see the writing in the air? Die young, going to die young Someone stopped the fall Your back is to the wall Then chain the sun Die young, young Die young, die young, young Die young, die young, die young, Die young, die young, die young, die young"
Black Sabbath,Turn Up the Night,"A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell. No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well. The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul. You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told. So get a good hold, yeah. Regiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are. A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far. A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know. So let it all go! Turn up the night! It feels so right! Night-time sorrow, taken like a pain. Black will not become a white, it's all the same. Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark. Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn! Get out of light! If it feels right, Shut off the light!"
Black Sabbath,Planet Caravan,"We sail through endless skies Stars shine like eyes The black night sighs The moon in silver trees Falls down in tears Light of the night The earth, a purple blaze Of sapphire haze In orbit always While down below the trees Bathed in cool breeze Silver starlight breaks down the night And so we pass on by the crimson eye Of great god Mars As we travel the uni"
Black Sabbath,Fairies Wear Boots,"Goin' home, late last night Suddenly I got a fright Yeah, I looked through a window and surprised what I saw Fairies with boots and dancing with a dwarf All right now! Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me He said, ""Son, son, you've gone too far 'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do"" Yeah!"
Black Sabbath,Wheels of Confusion,"Long ago I wandered through my mind In the land of fairy tales and stories Lost in happiness I knew no fears Innocence and love was all I knew Was it illusion? Soon the days went passing into years Happiness just didn't come so easy Life was born of fairy tales and daydreams Innocence was just another word Lost in the wheels of confusion Running through furnace of tears Eyes full of angered illusion Hiding in every daydream So I found that life is just a game But you know there's never been a winner Try your hardest, just to be a loser The world will still be turning when you're gone Yeah when you're gone!"
Black Sabbath,Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,"You see life through distorted eyes You know you have to learn The execution of your mind You really have to turn The race is run, the book is read The end begins to show The truth is out, the lies are old But you don't want to know Nobody will ever let you know When you ask the reasons why They just tell you that you're on your own Fill your head all full of lies The people who have crippled you You want to see them burn The gates of life have closed on you And there's just no return You're wishing that the hands of doom Could take your mind away And you don't care if you don't see again The light of day You bastards Where can you run to What more can you do No more tomorrow Life is killing you Dreams turn to nightmares Heaven turns to hell Burned out confusion Nothing more to tell, yeah Everything around you What's it coming to God knows as your dog knows Bog blast all of you Sabbath, bloody sabbath Nothing more to do Living just for dying Dying just for you, yeah"
Black Sabbath,Solitude,"My name it means nothing, my fortune is less My future is shrouded in dark wilderness Sunshine is far away, clouds linger on Everything I posessed, now they are gone They are gone Oh, where can I go to and what can I do? Nothing can please me, only thoughts are of you You just left when I begged you to stay I've not stopped crying since you went away You went away The world is a lonely place, you're on your own Guess I will go home, sit down and mourn Crying and thinking is all that I do Memories I have remind me of you Of you"
Black Sabbath,Loner,He's just a loner. He never says hello. A friend to no one. He's got no place to go. He don't look happy. He looks through furtive eyes. He ain't got nothing. No one to sympathize. He hides himself away. His secrets not revealed. As life just passes by He keeps himself concealed. A solitary man. An enigmatic child. A riddle never solved. A prisoner exiled. I wonder if the loner can assimilate. A life less lived alone plays devil's advocate. Has he ever tried to be happy? Reached out from inside. Someone on who he can depend. It's getting too late to recover. He won't stand a chance And into his own hell he'll descend. Don't descend. No understanding Of things we already know. He has to live his life And just learn how to let go. Communication's an impossibility. His own best friend but he's his own worst enemy. The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head. I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead. Come on you!
Black Sabbath,Neon Knights,"Oh no, here it comes again Can't remember when we came so close to love before Hold on, good things never last Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again Again and again, again and again, again Cry out, to legions of the brave Time again to save us from the jackals of the street Ride out, protectors of the realm Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights Circles and rings, dragons and kings Weaving a charm and a spell Blessed by the night, holy and bright Called by the toll of the bell Bloodied angels fast descending Moving on a never-bending light Phantom figures free forever Out of shadows, shining ever-bright Neon Knights All right Again and again, again and again and again"
Black Sabbath,I,"I am anger Under pressure Lost in cages, a prisoner The first to escape I am wicked I am legion Strength in numbers, a lie The number is one I, I, I Everything that I see is for me Yes, I am giant I'm a monster Breaking windows in houses Buildings of glass Rebel, rebel Holy outlaw Ride together, don't try it The power's in one I am standing alone But I can rock you On the edge of the blade But the knife can't cut the hero down I am virgin I'm a whore Giving nothing, the taker The maker of war I'll smash your face in But with a smile All together you'll never Be stronger than me Right here on my own But I still rock you Don't follow behind Just leave me on the outside But I can shock you But no one makes the hero bleed No, no, no I am hunger (no, no, no) Feed my head (no, no, no) All together, you'll never Never make the hero bleed (no, no, no)"
Black Sabbath,God Is Dead,"Lost in the darkness I fade from the light Faith of my father, my brother, my maker and savior Help me make it through the night Blood on my conscience And murder in mind Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb into impending doom Now my body is my shrine The blood runs free The rain turns red Give me the wine, you keep the bread The voices echo in my head Is God alive or is God dead? Is God dead? Rivers of evil Run through dying land Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal and borrow There is no tomorrow For the sinners will be damned Ashes to ashes You cannot exhume a soul Who do you trust when corruption and lust, creed of all the unjust Leaves you empty and unwhole When will this nightmare be over? Tell me! When can I empty my head? Will someone tell me the answer? Is God really dead? To safeguard my philosophy Until my dying breath I transfer from reality Into a living dead I empathize with enemies until the timing's right With God and Satan at my side From darkness will come light I watch the rain as it turns red Give me more wine I don't need bread These riddles that live in my head I don't believe that God is dead!

Death,Leprosy,"Bodies deformed way beyond belief Cast out from their concerned society Flesh contorting day after day Freak of the dark world is what the people say Their lives decay before their eyes There is no hope of cure Among their own kind they live A life that's so obscure First an arm and then a leg Deterioration grows Rotting while they breathe - Death comes slow Leprosy will take control and bring you to your death No chance of a normal life to live just like the rest Leprosy will spread with time, your body soon to change Appearance becomes hideous a sight too much to take Tuberculoid the most severe Decay of the nerves comes fast Sense of feeling soon to be gone Life will never last No hope of recovery after the nerves are eaten away Damage is done you feel no more pain Bones decay deterioration grows Origin of this horrid disease nobody knows Leprosy will spread with time, your body soon to changel"
Death,Story to Tell,"Drifting into the lives Seep Into The Soul Where emotions hide Dark skies were beating me down with shadows Of deceit, slashing at trust till it forever bleeds With doubts With pain With trust Is Pain When you think of me, In your multidimensional mind Try and wash the evil from your mind And open it When You taste the truth You will see like others Before me to you, I am past a story to tell To you I am past a story to Tell Tell it If you think you own the end Take another look At The script Of sadness Etched In the book Is pain When you think of me Before me to you, I am past a story to tell to you I am past a story to tell"
Death,Symbolic,I don't mean to dwell But I can't help myself When I feel the vibe And taste a memory Of a time in life When years seemed to stand still I close my eyes and sink within myself Relive the gift of precious memories In need of a fix called innocence When did it begin? The change to come was undetectable The open wounds expose the importance of our innocence A high that can never be bought or sold Symbolic acts So vivid Yet at the same time Were invisible Savor what you feel and what you see Things that may not seem important now But may be tomorrow Do you remember when Things seemed so eternal? Heroes were so real Their magic frozen in time The only way to learn Is be aware and hold on tight
Death,Without Judgement,"Guilty until proven innocent We condemn your soul and fate Never mind the possibilities Too busy for logic or to calculate Take part in a diminishing breed Where complex turns to simplicity When pain is acknowledged Frivolous calculations will be abolished Without judgement, what would we do? We would be forced to look At ourselves emerged in lost time assuming what may be Without judgement perception would increase a million times Distracted by the imagination That experiments with ease If you could taste it, it might be addictive Where life will crush those who defy Without judgement perception would increase a million times."
Death,Spirit Crusher,"It comes from the depths Of a place unknown to the Keeper of dreams If it could then it would steal The sun and the moon from the sky Beware Human at sight, monster at heart Don't let it inside it could Tear you right apart No guilt, it feeds in plain sight Spirit Crusher Stay strong and hold on tight Speaking in killing words The vicious kind that crush and kill No mercy, it's pleasure to taste The blood that it bled.

Death,Lack of Comprehension,A condeming fear strikes down Things they cannot understand An excuse to cover up weaknesses that lie within Lies Laying your guilt and pain On people that had no part in the molding of a life That creates its destruction Right before your very eyes A reflection of the mistakes To the end you will deny Your part in the demise of a life Lack of comprehension Thriving on your cliche Compelled by self-resentment Reaching into the minds of those that created The depression in which they In which they drowned their flesh and blood So easy to blame the Everlasting fear on a pathetic attempt To justify the ending of life Your help in ending of a life
Death,Together as One,"Labelled a creation of evil Ridiculed for their shocking appearance Sharing both pleasure and pain Two minds, two hearts, one soul Separating mentally An illusion of privacy Together - they absorb each other's lives As one - they will live and they will die A living hell has begun Displayed as a nightmare Criticized through words and eyes As they stare To the normal it seems grotesque Connected by a bond of flesh"
Death,The Philosopher,"Do you feel what I feel, see what I see, hear what I hear There is a line you must draw between your dream world and Reality Do you live my life or share the breath I breathe Lies feed your judgement of others Behold how the blind lead each other The philosopher You know so much about nothing at all Ideas that fall under shadows of theories that stand tall Thoughts that grow narrow upon being verbally released Your mind is not your own What sounds more mentally stimulating is how you make your Choice So you preach about how I'm supposed to be Yet you don't know your own sexuality"
Death,Empty Words,"Ashes and promises Share a bond through the winds of change Words are blown away When visions that should be Are tattooed in your mind The power to let go is sometimes hard to find The answer cannot be found In the writing of others or the words of a trained mind In a precious world of memories We find ourselves confined Claws so razor sharp Ripping at the spirit Promises, a potential to hurt, is anything real? When forever is to be until Deep inside, in the world of empty words No escaping from those haunting empty words Do you ever feel it? A craving that is so strong To by thought rewind in order to find Expectations that shined Through the doubt that soon would turn into the price Of what a word Will be worth when tomorrow comes To be and we are left Standing on our own and seeing what is real Empty words..."
Death,Defensive Personalities Rehearsals,"One mind divided into three, for every problem a personality Each one trying to protect, for the crisis a person they'll select With sorrow comes reassurance, with confusion there's ignorance Protecting the weak points of the mind Defensive personalities Violent one minute calm the next Defensive Personalities Passed down from generations, years of pain and complications Darkness was a punishment, memories time cannot mend Brutalized from the day of birth, to reality they can't return"
Death,Pull the Plug,"Memory's all that's left behind As I lay and wait to die Little do they know That I hear their choice of life End it now, it is the only way Too cruel, that is what they say Release me from this lonely world There is no hope Why don't you Pull the plug Let me pass away Don't want to live this way Once I had full control of my life I now behold a machine decides my fate End it now, it's all to late What has now been days, it seems like years To stay like this is what I fear Life ends so fast, so take your chance And make it last"
Death,God of Thunder,You've got something about you You've got something I need Daughter of Aphrodite Hear my words and take heed I was born on Olympus To my father a son I was raised by the demons Trained to reign as the one God of thunder and rock and roll The spell you're under Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul I'm the lord of the wastelands A modern day man of steel I gather darkness to please me And I command you to kneel Before the
Death,Living Monstrosity,"Every day Blows by in a world of corrupt addiction With life Comes pain withdrawals and deformation Breaking The mould of human appearance Contorting Bodies chemical interference The guilty one, innocent she now cries A life of hell, better off to die! Born without eyes, hands, and half a brain Being born addicted to cocaine Living monstrosity Freak for life they'll always be Never knowing love or hate Only the pain the drug creates (Solos) (Murphy) (Schuldiner) Some say she's naive, she's a stupid bitch Some say to forgive, guilty she should die The beginning Of the end begins at birth Breeding Masses of twisted screaming flesh An example We should make out of these creators of misfortune A serious Crime that should not be forgiven"
Death,Scavenger of Human Sorrow,"What pain will it take? To satisfy Your sick appetite Go in for the kill Always in sight, prey The time always right, feast Feed on the pain, taste Sorrow made flesh, sweet Live how you want Just don't feed on me If you doubt what I say I will make you believe Shallow are words From those who starve For a dream not their own to Slash and scar Big words small mind Behind the pain you will find a scavenger Of human sorrow Scavenger Abstract theory The weapon of choice used by a scavenger So you have traveled far Across the sea To spread your written brand Of misery Big words, small mind"
Death,Misanthrope,"From above and around Observations are collected Knowledge is taken in by curious life forms That may bring hope from beyond Beneath the giver of life, our sun An examination of another kind is done A view from those who stood high And breathing the sky An opinion from below and from above Some were decided, some were not A few looked away, but none forgot Misanthrope Hater of all mankind There is some hope For those who own their mind They came, they saw and acknowledged Some good, some bad Opinion: dangerous Stay where you are, don't get consumed By what they created from sheer neglet In denial of years and years of Shattered souls That were lost to the power of Fragile, frightful minds A few looked away, But none forgot"
Exhumed,Shattered Sanity,Gaze into the chasm Sights you can't un-see Lose your fucking mind Shattered sanity Witness ancient horrors From beyond reality Perception grows distorted Waking world a nightmare Your mind begins to rot Gouging out your eyes But the visions just won't stop Forever you're tormented You will never rest in peace A trauma never mended The horror will not cease Clutching at your flesh Blood runs cold Totally insane Losing all control Screaming out in fright Forever you will be A prisoner of your madness
Exhumed,A Song for the Dead,"The ashen grey muse commissions a new verse A song to while away the long sojourn in the hearse Yet all of us who danse macabre to these dour, dismal tunes Become cold, grim and hard as the dirt upon the tomb In darkened dirges death's knell peals out it's toll As another cadaver is consigned six feet down to its hole But ere the last shovel of dirt falls on the wall of the box We gravely offer a salute to those about to rot So lift up your severed heads, in a song for the dead Life's course ever runs red, so let no lyric remain unsaid As from our mouths the melody is bled, in a symphony scripted in red Like rats by the piper we're led, to join in this song for the dead The humor of the gallons never fails to ring true In this dead, bleak, sick world that we're hung, drawn and quartered though As each internecine instrument plays its own bloody part The hammering of coffin nails outpaces the beating of our hearts Symphonic surgery orchestrated, a cleaver conducts The execrable epiphany comes too late, just to reduce us to chunks Rising up from the sod heaves a gross, putrid breath As the chorus is joined in this song for the dead Truncated toccatas deranged, raked across barbed strings and hacked Eviscerated etudes for the de-brained, plucked upon heartstring stretched On the rack Medicinal movements decomposed Regurgitating oratorios obscene Forensic fugues and de-boned, mutilating the melody's method and means The crepitated coda dies in mid-refrain As the sheet-music is obscured by a sanguine scarlet stain Shattered stave lodged in your split-open splattered brain The ruptured meter falters as the bow is fretted once again Acrid arias are screeched The bloated thorax is breached Abrading viscera with bleach Grotesquely gavage the deceased Cleaving the clef Broken notes bleed into a mess Falling on ears so deaf So it ever is in death Carbonized cantatas corrupt ringing out, sewing seeds of dischord and Dismay Suppurated sonatas erupt, purulent pizzicatos slicing every which way The truncated cadence is sundered, bloody scraps of sheet music Unintellibly scrawled Threnodies resonate six feet under, to where all life's fractured melodies Will finally resolve The symphonic slaughter's swells without restraint As the cacophonous cadenza splits your eardrums clean in twain The repugnant orchestra pit an abattoir of death and pain The hatchet falls in sharp staccato until everyone is slain"

Exhumed,Horrendous Member Dismemberment,"Nailing the dismembered member to the table Hammer gleaming in my sweat soaked palm First excruciating blow to the scrotum is struck Hammering my genitals into a bloody pulp Agonizing self castration This hammer my tool of self-emasculation Disfigured bludgeoned stump Relentlessly smashing My own copulatory organ Savagely striking the pulverized mess Testicles crushed beyond recognition Punctured, pulped, and pounded Gouging out the pulsating gonads The scrotal sac is lacerated and split As the urethra is violently macerated My prepuce is now flayed to bits Collapsing of the corpus cavernosum Completely liquefying the testis and scrotum Experimenting with penile malleation The excruciating pain causes urinal vesation Disfigured bludgeoned stump The seminiferous tubules are splayed Rendering the organ sterile Severing of the epidydimis A vasectomy so vile"
Exhumed,The Red Death,"The rabble made sick, by infection, so quick And left anaemic Aided by pests, the skin is made wet With fever and sweat Abdominal pain, 'cause the sphincter is strained And they're driven insane Blood is expelled, while bubbles all swell It's bacterial hell Ensconce yourself in quarantine Sanctuary for the people of means No escaping, no delaying, no refraining The red death No forestalling, no stonewalling, no mothballing The read death Extremities rot, from gangrenous clots And odious snots Choking up bile, and other tastes vile The tongue is defiled Torment is felt, covered in welts As their guts melt Bloodied sputum, and fingers all numb All will succumb Blue bloods in isolation Preserved from contamination Capitulate to plague by degrees Affluenza of filth and disease No forestalling, no stonewalling, it comes calling"

The chill in the night air, cuts straight through to the bone You hear the chainsaw's rumble and you know you're not alone Naked, screaming and covered in blood There's no one there to help you, no one even could You will meet your death, alone in the woods Naked, screaming, and covered in blood Captured by the butchers, dragged back to their home To watch your friends all tortured, and hear their breaking bones Chained to the table, you scream as they gather 'round And as they close in you, you know you won't be found You meet your death, alone in the woods"
Exhumed,Deadest of the Dead,"In the deadest of nights I perform a graveside disservice Disinhuming the remains of those who I deem to deserve this A corpse dead to rights will Undergo this rigorous trashing Selecting the tomb of the poor stiff that Tonight I will be thrashing Exhumed from the shelter of earth's dusty Embrace for a morbid curiosity Then abruptly dismembered without Compunction, just pure feriocity Consumed and left to welter In shredded entrails and long dessciated pus Wiping the firt from my hands As I walk from the grave that I've trampled to dust Caskets uprooted, mausoleums Stained red, riding high six feet deep amongst the deadest of the dead A tombstone is the sole mute witness To necro-attrocities as I endeavor to Split this, corpse in half, stricken by my wrath The carcass is maimed Cleft by pick-axe, halved, quartered and smashed The gravesite's in flames Culled from the reams of obituaries deep in the cemetary, I torment the entombed The dead should be wary of the grudges I carry Deep into the gloom, riding high six feet under Inhale the stench of my nocturnal Plunderm I'll never find piece in a cold, hard death bed Until I have found The deadest of the dead Your insipid epitaph rots, In the dead-letter file A necrophile's smile beguiles Your remains thus defiled The decrepit Laughter echoes In the now vacant burial plot Decayed, dead and decomposed But in peace you'll never rot Piss on the unholy grave, torso carved and depraved Now gone the way of all flesh to give me this day my daily death The next to fall prey to my sepulchural slaughter Another dead festering Corpse whose demise has at last brought her Under the blade, she's carved Up and flayed Body dismembered No respects paid, I hack up the slayed Who no one remembers Chainsaw fucked to the hilt, her guts have all spilled I destroy the interred One foot in the grave, by the casket enslaved I'm an unholy terror, riding high six feet down Finding my niche in a hole in the ground One step over the dead-line I tread In this graveyard of stiffs I am the deadest of the dead"
Exhumed,Waxwork,"In my waxen world, time stands still Forever frozen like flies trapped in amber One perfect moment preserved, just ere the kill Gruesome atrocities transfixed in horror's chamber Poetry without motion, figures stranded midstream Waxen players in this dark drama of the macabre Mouths agape with terror but breathless to scream No death rattle heard, nor parting sors I am preserver of life through my morbid art For each mannequin was truly alive from the start So if the eyes seem to follow your gaze as you gawk Know that in the eyes of the dead, in their shadow you walk Cadavers molded in wax as their lives buried away More preening puppets to perform in the scenes that I play Features cast in the moment of dying preserved How they screamed as they met with their fates well deserved Waxwork Recreating the horror of the moment of death My models serve their purpose quite well Embalm their bodies in wax, capture their dying breath Drain the fluids to stave off the smell Like dolls that dance to their own funeral dirge They play out their death scenes interminably As prized their exhibits in my dark reserve They unfold their secrets only to me Life eternal in wax was their death's decree Suffering for my art, they surrendered to me So when their eyes lock with your gaze Look unflinchingly at death or turn away fast Skin blistered and softened as it was coated and sealed away Another preserved puppet to prance on the strings that I play The fear ensnared in their captive countenances I've trapped Mummified and memorialised in wax well-woven and wrapped So sit still in your place at the end of the blade By my design, death's hand find you just out of reach Another player in this deathly silent world that I have made Devoid of sound, fury or motion, sense, movement or speech Awaiting a terminus that never will come You're a marionette bound by my strings Trussed in this tomb of wax, your time here is not done For time does not quite end all things This is my life's work, this still, silent place A monument to the fear frozen in a cold, waxen face Take care not to stare into their eyes, whatever you do When you look deep into death, it sees back into you too Flesh bubbled and scalded, as this molten bath washed life away Wax covered my still-screaming prey Another piece for my prizing, recast in my mold Features harden and set as the wax grows stiff and cold"
Exhumed,Re Animated,"Lurking hulk of rotting flesh Far beyond the point of death Experiments re-animate Cadavers from their lifeless state Re-animated, reborn in bloodshed Re-animated, not yet fully Dead bodies rise, the living die Never understanding why All the lives they tried to save Were dragged into a hellish grave Not alive, not fully dead Torso searches for its head Corpses strewn around the morgue Walls are spattered, dripping gore Re-animated, not yet fully dead Decapitated maniac Armies of the dead brought back Severed head between your legs As for your worthless life you beg Distorting of a human life Tearing flesh, gouging eyes Try to run, it's too late Even death is no escape Re-animated, not fully dead"
Exhumed,Slaughter Maniac,Feel the plunging cleaver As it leaves your face avulsed Slashing at your flesh In pain you now convulse Excruciated - in pain you fucking die Mutilated - choke on the blood that drowns your feeble cries You know your fate is sealed As the bloody axe-blade drops Chopping through your bones until Your limbs are shorn clean off Slaughter maniac Raises high his axe You're the victim of his fucking gore attack Shreds of flesh surround you Gushing blood has slicked the floor The pieces of a human life Reduced to fucking gore Excruciated - in pain you fucking died Mutilated - choked on the blood that drowned your feeble screams
Exhumed,The Matter of Splatter,"Pernicious, a ghastly Gordian quandary to elucidate Pestiferous, a nebulous necrotic novelty to navigate Labyrinthine, a contumely carnal conundrum to cogitate Serpentine, an exulcerated entanglement to execrate Hands stained and filthy from digging deep for the answer That lies at the heart of the matter of splatter Eschatological, the grave matters with which we struggle Pathological, the perverse perpetuation of this purulent puzzle Repugnant, the wretched riddle unravels in a reeking revelation Repulsive, the final fetid farce yields such a rancid realization Now your morbid curiosity may finally be answered Deep in the heart of the matter of splatter A morbid matter on which to meditate or mutilate A deathly detail to deliberate and desiccate A sombre study in which sagacity is tantamount to insanity An insalubrious interest in the inhumed and the unsanitary An unhealthy pursuit of the purulent and parturient A feculent fixation upon the fetid filth and excrement An exhaustive examination of the excreted and the exhumed A tireless appetite to hill the silt atop the tomb Nebulous, the sanguineous solution is seldom seen before the last Amorphous, seemingly always six deep feet beyond your grasp Funereal, carnal cartography to chart the course of life's denouement Corporeal, the wretched revelation that you sought proves harder to swallow Than you'd thought That anatomy is destiny is the unforgiving answer Culled from the heart of the matter of splatter"
Exhumed,Dead End,"My occupation was a'calling, like a tumor, it within me swelled A path some found appalling, that I would come to know so well A cadaverous career awaited, the filthy task I'd undertake With a gruesome thirst for knowledge, that only the dead could slake My studies dismissed as morbid, incurring the headmaster's scorn My deathly imagination derided, and into the darkness borne From clandestine forays into graveyards, to the operating theater's grisly scenes My bloody studies dug ever deeper into the obscene and the unclean For in death's sleep what dreams may come? And in death's name, what deeds must be done As an anatomist, a necrologist But I'll never be an apologist My chosen path, to carve up stiffs A career dismissed as a dead end A surgeon's trade, a butcher's blade You mourn a rest to which you won't be laid To serve my much derided trade Your legacy will fade to a dead end The pounding of my father's coffin-nails beat a dolorous refrain But by staving in those caskets, a richer living could be gained My heart beat time with the hammer-falls I learned to pluck men from the grave And earned the name of ""resurrection-man"" playing that reviled trade As a resurrectionist, a necrologist My chosen path, to dig up stiffs A surgeon's trade A wooden spade To serve our much benighted trades"
Exhumed,Ripping Death,"Shredded, maimed and slaughtered, barbaric way to die Skin is ripped and mangled, before your very eyes Drenched in blood you welter, in pain you scream and howl Bones are smashed and broken, your torso disemboweled Ripping death Ripping fucking Death for you comes slowly, first there comes the pain Limbs torn off and twisted, stabbing through your brain In pieces you're dismembered, your body torn apart Ripping off your twisted face, puncturing your heart Ripping fucking death"

Exhumed,Sodomy and Lust,"Behind the scenes of destiny I adore you in this song for me Call me within your holy house to dwell Let me raise for myself in spell Voluptuously dancing daughters of the night sky Sing the rapturous love song with high Let your sweet scented juice run Waste away under the lashes of my whip Bath in sin Sadistic souls Break their crust Sodomy and lust Carnal desire runs through my veins Whipping boys and scapegoats cry in pain Psychopathic terror during their sleep My power asks why, my power is weak Spineless bundles of my excess Expurse of innocence and helplessness In the perfumes of my secret orison Fresh blood of children drops down on me Madness, crime, disgrace, ptomaine Excrements, contempt, violence, kill Ordeals if a thousand deads congealed in gloom Strike hard and deep, to hell with them master Mighty prophet's stature shall surpass the stars The passion is the smell of cremation I spit on your crapulous creed curse them!

Exhumed,Under the Knife,"Scalpels cleave and reave though crimson rivulets Weaving their cold and malignant minuets Carving out funereal figures in arcane alphabets Scars that will never heal or forget Like puzzle pieces, set askew, you've come undone The bleeding is ceaseless, you're turning blue, the end had begun Set down in writing, flesh, blood and bone, let death be done The pen is as mighty as the sword, sticks or stones, your end would be cast In stone, by either one Tenderly thanatographical threads are tread and traced Boiling blood will serve to warm this cold clinical embrace A clean precise cut to mark this morbid meeting place This knife, point where you and death came face to face The slab starts to spin around and around, as I take your hand in mine We move step by step within, without so much as a sound, death's dark design In time A slice to the left, then cut back to the right, movements scripted in this Dance of the dead Motions so deft, recalled by touch not by sight, footprints encrypted by Blood running red A pirouette on razor's edge leaves you breathless The slab plays host to an incisive macabre ballet A savage, slicing slaughter of the senses Now splayed Under the knife, your death hangs in the balance, on the edge of the blade Remember every slice l, of this jigsawed demise, and every part that I payed Cold steel burns like ice, leaves you dancing on nothing, loosed by Unsteady hands Under the knife, the caress of steel, just before the end Just before the end A bleeding patchwork design, in running scarlet writ Connected wounds intersecting from slit to bloody slit Such a tangled web of shreds and scars I've knit The liquid of life, leaks out through the red at your wrists May I have this last dance? As I take your last breath With a final flick of my wrist Remember every slice, of this jigsawed demise, and every part that I payed"
Exhumed,Rabid,"Infection spreads like wildfire Mouths begin to form Hydrophobic epidemic Spurs a lust for blood and bone Feral instincts awakened Devolved to savagery Preying upon each other In deranged ecstasy Salivating thirst - drink your blood Your arteries they'll burst - rabid A hunger slaked by flesh - eat your skin Thralls enslaved by death - rabid Death can come in many forms Closing in around you fast Scream in horror as your neighbors Are the ones who will make you breathe your last Primitive urges You once thought had been tamed Now rise to the surface To hack, rend and maim"
Exhumed,In the Mouth of Hell,"Locked within a padded cell, home for the deranged Condemned within these horrid walls, totally insane The fear within you starts to build, creeping up your spine Gaze on the unspeakable, forever lose your mind Terror chills your flesh Thoughts of gruesome death In the mouth of hell No one hears your death knell Terror-stricken, try to run, there is no escape Forbidden sights made of flesh, mind and soul are raped From beyond they arise, on sanity they feed Blood spurts from behind your eyes, fall onto your knees Slither through the walls Hear the darkness call Asylum lost to lunacy, walls painted red with death Portal to another world, far beyond the flesh You wander ever downward, not to be seen again Lost in darkened corridors - now you're one of them!"

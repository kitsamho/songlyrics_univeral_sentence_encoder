Snoop Dogg,Professional Rapper,"Hello, how can I help you? Hi, my name's Dave Burd Uh, I have an appointment today It's probably under ""Lil Dicky"", actually I'm a, I'm a rapper, so... Okay, and who are you here to see? Uh, Snoop Dogg? Says here ""Snoop D-o-g-g Oh, yeah, he's right down the hall, first door to your right Give him a knock and he should be right with you Thanks, it's uh, this door right here, right? Mm-hmm Thank you Grab a seat Thanks I'm Dave very nice to meet Dave, what it do? You can call me Dogg Let me just check your sheet No problem, sir, let me just say I'm a big fan of the shit that y'all make I can't lie, I been thinking about this all day All good, there's a reason that we called, Dave Let me start with your background Where you come from? Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond Before that Oh, you talking 'bout my hometown? Yeah I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham It's in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around So real shit you ain't never had to struggle for much I wouldn't say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap Elaborate Well I ain't never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school Like I was doing shit I had to do So when I finished undergrad, I'm cool And I can get whatever job I wanted But the job you wanted wasn't all that bumping Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming When you grow up like that Know you been racing them rats, you ain't been making them raps Boo hoo what a hardship How you paid to get the rap shit started? Man, my Bar Mitzvah money But don't diss me buddy I wasn't one of them youngins up on the block who had nothing to lose I must've wanted this a lot, I had something to choose Look at that, I can say there's something to prove up in your ass Yeah, I guess That's enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap? Oh my God, it's the best Bitches let me draw up on their breasts Literally I can reinvent myself I got a forum to project myself It's never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself It's kinda healthy Cool, now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals Sure In a club and a couple niggas threaten you Uh, I wouldn't do shit And I don't even get what that got to do with this? Shut the fuck up, rap's like life If you wanna do this, then you won't get far acting like a little bitch Nah, that's my niche! Don't get offended by this, but that's the market y'all missed That's the target I'll hit And that's the heart of my pitch I wanna do this whole thing different What the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different? Uh, you know, I-I think, like, you know Traditionally people have been doing the job, uh, you know The same kind of way for a long time But traditionally speaking, this shit works, right? Nah, like, I get that, but I-I just think that, you know You don't know if it could be working even better And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out I don't mean any disrespect by that I'm just saying I have a different background Like a different perspective way of looking at things Than your typical applicant So what are your biggest strengths? Well my flow is crazy, I can switch that amazing For example, I can be like ain't nobody fucking with Lil Dicky When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous Ripping this shit like it's never been did and the rhythm is never predictable 'Cause I can switch it, deliver this shit to whatever cadence you bitches prefer Alright, alright, I get it Top of that, lyrically I'm pretty damn clever (Go) Got a long bottom bitch, called a hoe Neville (Whoa) And I blow it from the jump, Derrick Rose knee (Oh) You can say I'm pretty smart how I know better And y'all been winning like Pistorius it's no feat Bro, I can go on and on I'm taking over any man like father-in-laws Okay enough of the punchlines That ain't showing me you different from the other guys Well, I don't know if they can run it like that But ain't nobody else doing funny type rap What's that? Well I can tell a story about my morning Watching Boy meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence Like the 14 year old Topanga Oh this shit like a joke to you? I don't get it Nah it ain't like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual Like as a guy So when I get up on the mic I ain't finna just lie Real recognize real, right? So what you trying to do? Five years from now, tell me bout the dude Well, I don't care about the money Like, it's the respect that I'm wanting Honestly, I just want to be one of the greats Where they gotta bring your boy up every debate I don't wanna leave the game the same In a nutshell, what's your legacy? Well, I wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand up rap With the random rap and the man like that for the people that was anti-rap Yet, the fans of rap started recognizing that anti-rap Is ironically one of the real brands of rap left That shit sound pretty damn complex I guess, I wanna be the best I just wanna do it my way And turn the whole game sideways And show people you ain't gotta be resigned to the highway You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight I ain't mad at that Well thanks, man, that's my plan of my attack Just let me in and I'ma rap the plaques And I ain't about to win them back to back I'm 'bout to win them like it's back to back to back to back to back 'Til I stop rapping You ain't even sold a damn album yet True That's a lot of talk from a wily vet Let alone a young rook nigga You misread me Nah this ain't a book nigga Well that's one of my flaws, I'm too competitive dawg No, you just fucking repetitive dawg I get it, you trying to be better than all But you ain't shit until cheddars involved I get that I gotta prove myself No shit you ain't done shit Think about that though Only doing this a couple of years One tape and I'm like this? This shit is aight for your first shi But you don't know if it's your worst shit You don't think finding out would be worth it? It might be, it might not But I'ma put your ass to work, kid Wait, like, like I have the job? Like really? Well one more thing, let me see if you could put a hook together What would you do for the hook for this song? You want me to make a hook up right now? Do I look like the type of nigga that like repeating himself? Alright, uh, okay Man do the hook I'm 'bout to be professional Homie, I'm professional Uh, maybe like a low voice type thing? Nigga, that shit is garbage man Well, you know, I feel like there might have been some upside to it But I'm not good at thinking of things on the spot like that Don't y'all normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes? Sometimes, but you know, that was some next level Dogg shit right there Yeah, you know, I'm just way better when I get to think things through Have my like that dual screen action that type of thing Whatever man, you tryna smoke a blunt? Right now? Dope, Juanita, bring some weed in here, please, thank you (You got it, Snoop, I'll be right there) Thanks, Juanita, super nice woman Nigga, why does everything you say sound so soft?

For once upon a time from the binds of your lowliness I could always find the right slot for your sacred key Six feet deep is the incision In my heart, that barless prison Discolours all with tunnel vision Sunsetter Nymphetamine Sick and weak from my condition This lust, this vampyric addiction To her alone in full submission None better Nymphetamine, nymphetamine Nymphetamine girl My nymphetamine girl Wracked with your charm I am circled like prey Back in the forest where whispers persuade More sugar trails more white lady laid Than pillars of salt Fold to my arms hold their mesmeric sway And dance out to the moon as we did in those golden days Christening stars I remember the way We were needle and spoon mislaid in the burning hay For once upon a time from the bind of your holiness Nymphetamine (nymphetamine)"
Cradle of Filth,Gabrielle,"Foul snake despair Where once you darkened gardens Another coils there Where twice you sliced all hope from me And left these present scars An insane love now burns above The weft of incandescent stars Hilt your dripping fangs that range Skywards to rend apart I might have sang of wings unchained But long before I locked my heart For Gabrielle A fit and perfect stitch of foreign parts Whose beauty fostered poets Whose laugh like silver belts Thawed your bitter winter from my path Gabrielle Where once you peddled secrets Another spoils there With speech that sweetens drowning In deep lagoons of eyes And legs that begged apologies For lengths that mesmerised Spare your hissing sentiments For her fee welts more than thine Though no malice she weans Just a palace of dreams Where windswept chambers pine Whose hair-spun onyx is run with gold Her rouge lips smack of dark blood Her name in whisper rolls Forever on my tongue Lest her memory dissolve Oh, Gabrielle Once crucified I would have died A thousand more times Just to feel her breath On my neck as a fervent lover To drown her sighs In floods of tears so well refined And blind from spying her In the arms of others Buried inside Where she's all but mine Save for those that dine Oh her, on her perfect carcass Where once you wreaked my misery Another toils there For long lost Gabrielle Whose nightly spreading grin Persists in other faces By whom I'm slowly taken in"
Cradle of Filth,Hallowed Be Thy Name Shallow Be My Grave,"I'm waiting in my cold cell When the bell begins to chime Reflecting on my past life And it doesn't have much time 'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the gallows pole The sands of time for me are running low, motherfuckers Running low When the priest comes to read me the last rites Take a look through the bars at the last sights Of a world that has gone very wrong for me Can it be that there's some sort of error Hard to stop the surmounting terror Is it really the end not some crazy dream? Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming It's not easy to stop from screaming But words escape me when I try to speak Tears they flow but why am I crying? After all I'm not afraid of dying Don't I believe that there never is an end As the guards march me out to the courtyard Somebody cries from a cell, 'God be with you' If there's a god then why has he let me go? As I walk my life drifts before me And though the end is near I'm not sorry Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away Mark my words, believe my soul lives on Don't worry now that I have gone I've gone beyond to seek the truth So when you know that your time is close at hand Maybe then you'll begin to understand Life down here is just a strange illusion Hallowed be thy name Hallowed be thy name..."
Cradle of Filth,Summer Dying Fast,"Through acrid clouds of summer flies The garden swells with a thousand more wise Forever flung to celestial dreams Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene I watch the storm approaching The darkness calls my name The trees are growing restless They feel the season change Their fruit has putrified Forbidden once and bound to die The thread of life lies severed On the brink of paradise Grinning winds of hate unfurled Dash towers tall that grip the sun Talons stretch her veil Reclamation, our time has come... Autumn spreads its golden wings And lays the path for those unseen A tangled web of evil spun at last... Winter spawn from barren thighs To readdress, to slay the blind And throw the reins untethered to the skies They pray to the full moon rising Diana moving with such infinite grace Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall How many secrets can they read by your face? Will they know of majesty Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores? Will their ""god"" of bridled love Assuage our rule from planes above Or shrink in fear from Chaos roused for war? WAR! Wrest askew the nails That have held you, lurking deep September prayers are waning Burn the shrines of fettered sheep Spearhead the insurrection Of a world that seeks no end ""We are what we are, what we shall be, again..."" Again... Appear; draped in terror To the comfort of your kin Stain the milky sunset red And let the others in... Summer's dying..."

Cradle of Filth,Her Ghost in the Fog,"The moon, she hangs like a cruel portrait Soft winds whisper the bidding of trees As this tragedy starts with a shattered glass heart And the mid-nightmare trampling of dreams But oh, no tears please Fear and pain may accompany death But it is desire that shepherds its certainty As we shall see She was divinity's creature that kissed in cold mirrors A queen of snow, far beyond compare Lips attuned to symmetry sought her everywhere Dark liquored eyes, an Arabian nightmare She shone on watercolors of my pond life as pearl Until those who couldn't have her, cut her free of this world That fateful eve when the breeze stank of sunset and camphor Their lanterns chased phantoms and threw An inquisitive glance, like the shadows they cast On my love picking rue by the light of the moon Putting reason to flight or to death is their way They crept through woods mesmerized By the taffeta ley of her hips that held sway Over all they surveyed save a mist on the rise A deadly blessing to hide her ghost in the fog They raped and left, five men of God, her ghost in the fog Dawn discovered her there beneath the cedar's stare Silk dress torn, her raven hair flown to gown her beauty bared Was starred with frost, I knew her lost I wept 'til tears crept back to prayer She'd sworn me vows in fragrant blood ""Never to part, lest jealous Heaven stole our hearts"" Then this I screamed,""Come back to me For I was born in love with thee So why should fate stand in between?"" And as I drowned her gentle curves With dreams unsaid and final words I espied a gleam trodden to earth The church bell tower key The village mourned her by the by For she'd been a witch, their men had longed to try And I broke under Christ seeking guilty signs My tortured soul on ice A queen of snow Far beyond compare Lips attuned to symmetry Sought her everywhere Trappistine eyes An Arabian nightmare She was Erzulie possessed Of a milky white skin My porcelain yin A graceful angel of sin And so for her The breeze stank of sunset and camphor My lantern chased her phantom and blew Their chapel ablaze and all locked in to a pain Best reserved for judgement that their bible construed Putting reason to flight Or to flame unashamed I swept from cries Mesmerized By the taffeta ley Or her hips that held sway Over all those at bay Save a mist on the rise A final blessing to hide Her ghost in the fog And I embraced Where lovers rot"
Cradle of Filth,Heartbreak and Seance,"Before the war, this grave darksome pall Pressed upon the face of England We were sovereign to nothing less Than the map of our souls solicitous to reign Together in a peace these wicked times disdain Then Empire saw much more to gain The crown discounts our loss Life cannot count the cost These numbers fount like water The dead, the dying, those on route to slaughter Valentine, sweet spine entwined I am sorry that I left you here, in time I will find the path back from the other side So keep a candle burning in your heart that is my shrine No Momento Mori For he passed away for faraway glory So tear the pages from this castaway story Spilling tears fill her lachrymatory She seeks to pierce the veil Melancholia speaks the fiercest tale Weeks are growing lonelier ever stonier regaled Love's bond responding beyond the pale The planchette is promissory Purveyance of this seance In obeisance to the spirits before their dismissory So please accept my kisses through the whispers of the Ouija board I suffer alone So far from home watching you from a distance A shadow's persistence to roam No time to atone You flower alone Beautifully graven you cut a black raven Whose tower has flown In obeisance to the spirits, ghosts that haunt amiss, amie Winter seems far colder Without you by my shoulder now this year Faith's blinding glare advanced to frost Finds her there, entranced to cross To breach death's porous border And reach where breath affords no quarter Helpless, I see her resolve harden This is where it ends, how the wretchedness portends The knife in her hand, on the stretch to the promised land And this is how they found my light Clutching tight that fateful telegram"
Cradle of Filth,The Death of Love,"Her penultimate sighs called softly on the kindling wind Her saintly eyes filling with tears, lifting with truth And then a golden flash like the onset of heaven Leaving her screams breaking my heart And in the grip of fire I knew the death of love Where will you be when they tense for warfare? What will you see with your innocence there? Where will you be my darling? Where will you be when God is glorifying? There we will be between the dead and dying Prophecies and glory forge a massive disdain For lying passive in the shadows whilst the enemy reigns Devoted to the votive, holy standard above By command of the king of heaven came the death of love Where will you be when they're vilifying? How will they see when the truth is blinding? Where will you be when the dark is rising? How will you keep from it's terrorizing? Burning was the sunset like the portent of doom On the saintly iron maiden as she fell from her wound But visions and ambition never listened to submission And as she was on a mission from the highest above To Lord upon the slaughter like a sword through hissing water She arose where archers sought her for the death, the death of love The righteous death of love Gilles adored her drama, her suit of pure white armor Blazed against the English in a torrent of light And as they rallied onto night A cancer fled his soul, dissolving Framed amid the thick of fire Aflame, a Valkyrie She made him click without desire And in his eyes she swam a Goddess And even when they caught her breath Her words would leave a scar For only in the grip of darkness Will we shine amidst the brightest stars How will you breathe when their wheels are turning? How will you know if the sky is burning? Where will you be when Babel builds my fire? Will you not flee and label me pariah? Where will you be when they light my pyre? Aligned with Joan in all that was enthroned and divine He swore to score the crimes, jackdaws poured on this dove Crimes he knew alone derived from minds of the blind The church unfurled for murder perched upon the death of love She claimed the skies were lit with spires And even when she fought for breath"

Cradle of Filth,From the Cradle to Enslave,"Two thousand fattened years like maniacs Have despoiled our common grave Now what necrophagous Second Coming backs From the cradle to enslave? Sickle constellations Stud the belts that welt the sky Whilst the Bitter winter moon Prowls the clouds, dead-eyed Like shifting parent flesh Under silk matricide... Watchful as she was upon Eden Where every rose arbour and orchard she swept Hid the hissing of a serpent Libido In an ancient tryst with catastrophe Soon to be kept Hear that hissing now on the breeze As through the plundered groves of the carnal garden A fresh horror blows But ten billion souls Are blind to see the rotting wood for the trees This is the theme to a bitter Armageddon Nightchords rake the heavens Pandaemonaeon And what use are prayers to that ""god""? As devils bay concenus for the space to piss On your smouldering faith And the the mouldering face Of this world long a paradise lost This is the end of everything Hear the growing chora that a new dawn shall bring Dance macabre ""neath the tilt of the zodiac Now brighter stars shall reflect on our fate What sick activities will be freed when those lights burn black? The darkside of the mirror always threw our malice back... I see the serpentine in your eyes The nature of the beast as revelations arrive Our screams shall trail to Angels For those damned in flames repay All sinners lose their lot on Judgement Day We should have cut our losses as at Calvary But our hearts like heavy crosses held the vain belief Salvation, like a promised nation Gleamed a claim away... This is the end of everything you have ever known Buried like vanquished reason Death in season Driven like the drifting snow Peace, a fragile lover, left us fantasising war On our knees or another fucker's shore Heiling new flesh Read, then roared To a crooked cross and a Holy Cause What else be whipped to frenzy for? Rear the tragedies That the Seraphim shall sing Old adversaries Next of Eve Now they're clawing back I smell their cumming As through webbed panes of meat Led by hoary Death They never left Dreaming sodomies To impress on human failure When we've bled upon our knees Tablatures of gravel law Shall see Gehennah paved When empires fall And nightmares crawl From the cradle to enslave..."

The Bible's where it all began Its propaganda sells despair And spreads the virus everywhere Religion is hate, religion is fear, religion is war Religion is rape, religion's obscene, religion's a whore The pestilence is Jesus Christ, there never was a sacrifice No man upon the crucifix Beware the cult of purity, infectious imbecility I've made my choice: Six six six Corruption breeds the pedophiles, don't pray for the priest Confession finds the lonely child, God preys on the weak You think your soul can still to be saved I think you're fuckin' miles away Scream out loud, here's where you begin Forgive me Father, for I have sinned The target's fucking Jesus Christ, I would've lead the sacrifice And nailed Him to the crucifix Jesus is pain, Jesus is gore Jesus is the blood that's spilled in war He's everything, He's all things dead He's pulling on the trigger pointed at your head Through fear you're sold into the fraud Revelation, revolution, I see through your Christ illusion The war terror just drags along My war with God is going strong His propaganda sells despair And spreads the violence everywhere There is no fucking Jesus Christ, there never was a sacrifice"
Slayer,Payback,"You need to take a closer look at me 'Cause I was born to be the thorn in your side No matter what you think you're gonna see You never wanted this barrage of fucking pride You don't want none of me You've got a fucking catheter in your brain Pissing your common sense away When you draw first blood you can't stop this fight For my own peace of mind, I'm going to Tear your fucking eyes out, rip your fucking flesh off Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass Fuck you and your progress, watch me fucking regress You were made to take the fall, now you're nothing Payback's a bitch motherfucker You only live to be a parasite Your life must suck when nothing's going your way Everything melts away before your eyes You're just a punk that doesn't have the sense to get away Get the fuck away You were made to take the fall, now you're nothing, now you're nothing I will never become your fucking scapegoat I don't know how it feels to come up short I only want vengeance to come shining down on me I don't want you to die before I get the chance to kill you myself This is for the mindfuck, this is for the hell of it This is for me, I'm going to You ain't fucking shit!"
Adele,Make You Feel My Love,"When the rain is blowin' in your face And the whole world is on your case I could offer you a warm embrace To make you feel my love When the evenin' shadows and the stars appear And there is no one there to dry your tears I could hold you for a million years I know you haven't made your mind up yet But I would never do you wrong I've known it from the moment that we met No doubt in my mind where you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue I'd go crawling down the avenue No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do The storms are raging on the rolling sea And on the highway of regret The winds of change are blowing wild and free You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true Nothing that I wouldn't do Go to the ends of the Earth for you"
Adele,Take It All,"Didn't I give it all? Tried my best Gave you everything I had, everything and no less Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down? Maybe you got too used to, well having me around Still how can you walk away from all my tears? Its gonna be an empty road without me right here But go on and take it Take it all with you Don't look back at this crumbling fool Just take it all with my love Take it all with my love Maybe I should leave to help you see Nothing gets better than this And this is everything we need So is it over? Is this really it? You're giving up so easily I thought you loved me more than this I will change if I must Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust Oh if only, if only you knew Everything I do is all for you Just take it all"
Adele,Someone Like You,"I heard that you're settled down That you found a girl and you're married now I heard that your dreams came true Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy? Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too Don't forget me, I beg I'll remember, you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies Only yesterday was the time of our lives We were born and raised in a summer haze Bound by thee surprise of our glory days Nothing compares, no worries or cares Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? I wish nothing but the best for you"
Adele,Hometown Glory,"I've been walking in the same way as I did Missing out the cracks in the pavement And tutting my heel and strutting my feet Is there anything I can do for you dear? Is there anyone I could call? No and thank you, please Madam I ain't lost, just wandering Round my hometown Memories are fresh Oh, the people I've met Are the wonders of my world Are the wonders of this world I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades I like it in the city when two worlds collide You get the people and the government Everybody taking different sides Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit Shows that we are united Shows that we ain't gonna take it Of my world Yeah!"
Adele,Hiding My Heart,"This is how the story went I met someone by accident Who blew me away Blew me away And it was in the darkest of my days When you took my sorrow and you took my pain And buried them away, buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you When the day is done And wake up to your face against the morning sun But like everything I've ever known You'll disappear one day So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station Put a kiss on top of your head Watched you wave And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers And neon lights and waiting papers That I call home I call that home Away, yeah Woke up feeling heavy hearted I'm going back to where I started The morning rain And though I wish that you were here On that same old road that brought me here It's calling me home I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away"
Adele,One and Only,"You've been on my mind I grow fonder everyday Lose myself in time Just thinking of your face God only knows Why it's taken me so long To let my doubts go You're the only one that I want I don't know why I'm scared I've been here before Every feeling, every word I've imagined it all You'll never know If you never try To forgive your past And simply be mine I dare you to let me be your Your one and only Promise I'm worthy To hold in your arms So come on and give me a chance To prove that I'm the one who can Walk that mile Until the end starts If I've been on your mind You hang on every word I say You lose yourself in time At the mention of my name Will I ever know How it feels to hold you close And have you tell me Whichever road I choose you'll go 'Cause I've been here before I promise I'm worthy I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart (Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) So I dare you to let me be your Come on and give me a chance"
Adele,I ll Be Waiting,"Hold me closer one more time Say that you love me in your last goodbye Please forgive me for my sins Yes, I swam dirty waters But you pushed me in I've seen your face under every sky Over every border and on every line You know my heart more than I do We were the greatest, me and you But we had time against us And miles between us The heavens cried I know I left you speechless But now the sky has cleared and it's blue And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again I'll put my hands up I'll do everything different I'll be better to you I'll be somebody different Let me stay here for just one more night Build your world around me And pull me to the light So I can tell you that I was wrong I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn Time against us (time against us) Miles between us (miles between us) Heavens cried I'll be waiting"
Adele,Rolling in the Deep,"There's a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Finally, I can see you crystal clear Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare See how I'll leave with every piece of you Don't underestimate the things that I will do Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us They keep me thinking that we almost had it all The scars of your love, they leave me breathless I can't help feeling We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me) Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) You had my heart inside of your hands And you played it to the beat Baby, I have no story to be told But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn Think of me in the depths of your despair Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared Could have had it all But you played it with a beating Throw your soul through every open door Count your blessings to find what you look for Turn my sorrow into treasured gold You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown It all, it all, it all But you played it You played it You played it to the beat"
Adele,I Found a Boy,"I thought I told you, he'd be home soon Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true I fall short each time, every time he ain't here You and your charm creep closer, closer and near Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call You're the wiser one, disguised from greed And I'm just a child who longs on her knees But I found a boy who I love more Than I ever did you before So stand beside the river I cried And lay yourself down Look how you want me now that I don't need you So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees At the first sight of you crawling back to me To whisper, ""Will you leave your man?"" 'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me I won't stand by you 'Cause I found a boy who I love more I ain't yours for no taking You must be mistaken I could never look into your eyes And settle for wrong and ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more Than you ever did before So stand beside the river you cried Look how you want me now, but I don't need you"
Adele,Love in the Dark,"Take your eyes off of me so I can leave I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me This is never ending, we have been here before But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore Please stay where you are Don't come any closer Don't try to change my mind I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark It feels like we're oceans apart There is so much space between us Baby we're already defeated Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight Please don't fall apart I can't face your breaking heart I'm trying to be brave Stop asking me to stay We're not the only ones I don't regret a thing Every word I've said You know I'll always mean It is the world to me That you are in my life But I want to live And not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me"
Adele,Million Years Ago,"I only wanted to have fun Learnin' to fly, learnin' to run I let my heart decide the way When I was young Deep down I must have always known That this would be inevitable To earn my stripes I'd have to pay And bare my soul I know I'm not the only one Who regrets the things they've done Sometimes I just feel it's only me Who can't stand the reflection that they see I wish I could live a little more Look up to the sky, not just the floor I feel like my life is flashing by And all I can do is watch and cry I miss the air, I miss my friends I miss my mother, I miss it when Life was a party to be thrown But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets Where I grew up and found my feet They can't look me in the eye It's like they're scared of me I try to think of things to say Like a joke of a memory But they don't recognise me now In the light of day Who never became who they thought they'd be I miss my mother I miss it when A million years ago"
Adele,Best for Last,"Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve? It's been there for days on end and It's been waiting for you to open up Yours too baby, come on now I'm trying to tell you just how I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally Say that it's always been me That's made you feel a way you've never felt before And I'm all you need and that you never want more Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue But you'd save the best for last Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix This is not routine with you it don't mean that much to me You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me? Yeah Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest It turns out it ain't enough? You're still not mentioning love What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly? I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her And I think that I know things may never change I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel a way you've never felt before How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know I find it hard to let go and give up on you Seems I love the things you do Like the meaner you treat me more eager I am To persist with this heartbreak of running around And I will do until I find myself with you and Make you feel a way you've never felt before And be all you need so that you'll never want more And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you"
Adele,Set Fire to the Rain,"I let it fall, my heart And as it fell, you rose to claim it It was dark and I was over Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they were strong, but my knees were far too weak To stand in your arms without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Well, it burned while I cried 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you I could stay there Close my eyes, feel you here forever You and me together, nothing is better 'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew I set fire to the rain And I threw us into the flames When we fell, something died 'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door That heart you caught must be waiting for you Even now when we're already over I can't help myself from looking for you Watched it pour as I touch your face 'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh Oh, no Let it burn, oh Let it burn"
Adele,Can t Let Go,"When did it go wrong I will never know I have loved you all my life How did it slow down I go round and round Thinking about it all the time I gave you heaven on a platter, baby I gave you everything you never gave me I never lied and I never faked it Only wanted for you to save me This love, it ain't over yet There's too much that I haven't said Did you find the note that I wrote? I hid it in the seam of your coat It was hard to write with a lump in my throat Do you even know that I can't let go? Why were you so cold Let the truth be told Tell me was it all for the thrill? What was I thinking I gave you everything But you still went for the kill U-u-uh, sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark U-u-uh, I thought I died in your arms It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat Hope you know, I won't let go"

Adele,Water Under the Bridge,"If you're not the one for me Then how come I can bring you to your knees? Why do I hate the idea of being free? And if I'm not the one for you You've gotta stop holding me the way you do Oh honey if I'm not the one for you Why have we been through what we have been through? It's so cold out here in your wilderness I want you to be my keeper But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down Let me down gently don't pretend That you don't want me Our love ain't water under the bridge Woaah, woaaah Say that our love ain't water under the bridge What are you waiting for? You never seem to make it through the door And who are you hiding from? It ain't no life to live like you're on the run Have I ever asked for much? The only thing that I want is your love Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
Adele,Hello,"Hello, it's me I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet To go over everything They say that time's supposed to heal ya But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be When we were younger and free I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us And a million miles Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the outside At least I can say that I've tried To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you? It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry I hope that you're well Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

Adele,River Lea,"Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea There was something in the water, now that something's in me Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, in my veins It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain Oh, It's in my roots, in my veins So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips River Lea, River Lea The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea"

There must be something in the water Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew How do you keep me coming back for more After all we've been through I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me Inside of my hands Your love drives me crazy It's hard to understand just why I want you to love me I want you to love me... Who knows why I love you It could be something in the air I breath Whatever it is, I depend on it Where does the time go? I spend every single moment daydreaming of you I can't describe how I feel, it feels right It's above and beyond me inside of my head You were a shock in the dark that blew me away And you left your mark and it never will fade You ignited a spark, let the fires away Are you ready, ready? You have a place in my heart that will always be yours You are the peak and art of my universe Every piece and part, you were the first I am ready, ready It's above and beyond me, inside of my head Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why I want you It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands"
Adele,He Won t Go,"Some say, I'll be better without you But they don't know you like I do Or at least the sides I thought I knew I can't bear this time It drags on as I lose my mind Reminded by things I find Like notes and clothes you've left behind Wake me up, wake me up when all is done I won't rise until this battle's won My dignity's become undone But I won't go I can't do it on my own If this ain't love then what is? I'm willing to take the risk I won't go So petrified I'm so scared to step into this ride What if I lose my heart and fail the climb? I won't forgive me if I give up trying I heard his voice today I didn't know a single word he said Not one resemblance to the man I met Just a vague and broken boy instead There will be times We'll try and give it up Bursting at the seams, no doubt We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces So watch them turn to dust But nothing will ever taint us Will he- will he still remember me? Will he still love me even when he's free? Or will he go back to the place Where he would choose the poison over me? When we spoke yesterday He said to hold my breath and sit and wait ""I'll be home so soon, I won't be late."" He won't go He can't do it on his own He's willing to take the risk So I won't go 'Cause he won't go We're willing to take the risk"
Adele,When We Were Young,"Everybody loves the things you do From the way you talk To the way you move Everybody here is watching you 'Cause you feel like home You're like a dream come true But if by chance you're here alone Can I have a moment? Before I go? 'Cause I've been by myself all night long Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie You sound like a song My God this reminds me, of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time That we might be exactly like we were Before we realized We were scared of getting old It made us restless It was just like a movie It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears Nobody told me that you'd be here And I'd swear you moved overseas That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie You still sound like a song My God, this reminds me, of when we were young We were sad of getting old When we were young (When we were young) It's hard to win me back Everything just takes me back To when you were there And a part of me keeps holding on Just in case it hasn't gone I guess I still care Do you still care? My God, this reminds me Of when we were young Oh I'm so mad I'm getting old It makes me reckless"
Adele,Tired,"Hold my hand while you cut me down It had only just begun but now it's over now And your in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold On my eyes your were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night When I Fell off your mind I'm tired of trying Your teasing ain't enough Fed up of biding your time When I don't get nothing back And for what, and for what, and for what Boy I'm tired Where'd you go when you stay behind I looked up and inside down and outside only to find A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile I get closer you obviously prefer her Boy I'm tired of trying (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms I couldn't help believe you trick me back into them Even though I'm tired of trying Boy I'm tired."
Adele,Chasing Pavements,"I've made up my mind Don't need to think it over If I'm wrong, I am right Don't need to look no further This ain't lust I know this is love But, if I tell the world I'll never say enough 'Cause it was not said to you And that's exactly what I need to do If I end up with you Should I give up? Or should I just keep chasin' pavements Even if it leads nowhere? Or would it be a waste Even if I knew my place? Should I leave it there? I build myself up And fly around in circles Waitin' as my heart drops And my back begins to tingle Finally, could this be it Or, should I give up? Or should I just keep on chasin' pavements Or should I just keep on chasin' pavements? Should I just keep on chasin' pavements? Oh-oh"
Adele,Crazy for You,"Found myself today Singing out loud your name You said I'm crazy If I am, I'm crazy for you Sometimes sitting in the dark Wishing you were here Turns me crazy But it's you who makes me lose my head And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible You drift into my head And turn me into a crumbling fool Tell me to run and I'll race If you want me to stop I'll freeze And if you want me gone, I'll leave Just hold me closer, baby And make me crazy for you Crazy for you Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin I wish you'd come over Send me spinning closer to you My oh my, how my blood boils It's sweet taste for you Strips me down bare And gets me into my favourite mood I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away But the more I do The crazier I turn into Pacing floors and opening doors Hoping you'll walk through And save me boy Because I'm too crazy for you"
Adele,Turning Tabels,"Close enough to start a war All that I have is on the floor God only knows what we're fighting for All that I say, you always say more I can't keep up with your turning tables Under your thumb, I can't breathe So, I won't let you close enough to hurt me No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me I cant give you, what you think you gave me It's time to say goodbye to turning tables To turning tables Under haunted skies I see you, ooh Where love is lost, your ghost is found I've lived a hundred storms to leave you As hard as you try, no I will never be knocked down So, I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no I won't ask you, you to just desert me Turning tables Next time I'll be braver I'll be my own savior And if the thunder calls for me Standing on my own two feet I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no Turning tables, yeah Turning, oh"
Adele,All I Ask,"I will leave my heart at the door I won't say a word They've all been said before, you know So why don't we just play pretend Like we're not scared of what is coming next Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong I know there is no tomorrow All I ask is If this is my last night with you Hold me like I'm more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how this ends Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty It's already in your eyes And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me No one knows me like you do And since you're the only one that matters Tell me who do I run to? Let this be our lesson in love Let this be the way we remember us I don't wanna be cruel or vicious And I ain't asking for forgiveness"
Adele,My Same,"You said I'm stubborn and I never give in I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that I think you're giving out way too much in fact I say we've only known each other a year You say I've known you longer my dear You like to be so close, I like to be alone I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor Walking with each other think we'll never match at all But we do-o But we do do do do But we do do do do do do do do I thought I knew myself somehow you know me more I've never known this never before You're the first to make out whenever we argue I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you You're so provocative, I'm so conservative You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining You'd think we wouldn't, we do-o Favouritism ain't my thing but In this situation I'll be glad In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception But we do-o-o-o"
Adele,Remedy,"I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breath Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life This ain't easy it's not meant to be Every story has it's scars When the pain cuts you deep When the night keeps you from sleeping Just look and you will see That I will be your remedy When the world seems so cruel And your heart makes you feel like a fool I promise you will see That I will be, I will be your remedy No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through Your love, it is my truth And I will always love you Love you I will be, I will be That I will be, I will be, I will be... Your Remedy"
Adele,Melt My Heart to Stone,"Right under my feet is air made of bricks It pulls me down turns me weak for you I find myself repeating like a broken tune And I'm forever excusing your intentions And I give in to my pretendings Which forgive you each time Without me knowing They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up You say my name like there could be an us I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed So desperately I try to link it with my head But instead I fall back to my knees As you tear your way right through me I forgive you once again You've burnt my heart to stone Why do you steal my hand? Whenever I'm standing my own ground You build me up, then leave me dead Well I hear your words you made up I say your name like there should be an us"
Adele,You ll never see me again,In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face From the deepest part of my regret I hear the words I wish I'd said At the dawning of the day I can't bare to see the light I make up memories in my head They help to fill the emptiness you've left. I can't drown in your tears I won't face your fears I need to fight my own You'll never see me again Oh baby in time Let the waves take me under I know I'll survive They help to fill the emptiness you've left Let the floor beneath of me fall Let the sky come crashing down Turn all my right to wrong But after you life goes on I've been learning to live without you now It's taken all of my strength But I'm stronger now But after you that goes on
Adele,Don t You Remember,"When will I see you again? You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said No final kiss to seal any seams I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head But don't you remember? Don't you remember? The reason you loved me before Baby, please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me? Or have you completely erased me from your memory? I often think about where I went wrong The more I do, the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness Gave you the space so you could breathe I kept my distance so you would be free And hope that you'd find the missing piece To bring you back to me Why don't you remember?"
Adele,I Miss You,"I want every single piece of you I want your heaven and your oceans too Treat me soft but touch me cruel I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby Bring the floor up to my knees Let me fall into your gravity Then kiss me back to life to see Your body standing over me Baby, don't let the lights go down Lights go down lights go down Down down down I miss you when the lights go out It illuminates all of my doubts Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go Baby, give me light I love the way your body moves Towards me from across the room Brushing past my every groove No one has me like you do, baby Bring your heart I'll bring my soul But be delicate with my ego I want to step into your great unknown With you and me setting the tone We play so dirty in the dark Cause we are living worlds apart It only makes it harder, baby Harder, baby harder, baby harder, baby harder, baby Ooh (I miss you)"
Adele,Cold Shoulder,"You say it's all in my head And the things I think just don't make sense So where you been then? Don't go all coy Don't turn it 'round on me like it's my fault See I can see that look in your eyes The one that shoots me each and every time (each and every time) You grace me with your cold shoulder Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You shower me with words made of knives These days when I see you You make it look like I'm see-through Do tell me why you waste our time When your heart ain't admitting you're not satisfied You know I know just how you feel I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder Time and time again, I play the role of fool (Just for you) Even in the daylight when you think that I don't see you Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find 'Though I do know how you play"
Adele,Sweetest Devotion,With your loving There ain't nothing That I can't adore The way I'm running with you honey Means we can break every law I find it funny that you're the only One I never looked for There is something in your loving That tears down my walls I weren't ready then I'm ready now I'm heading straight for you You will only be eternally The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion Hit me like an explosion All of my life I've been frozen The sweetest devotion I know I'll forever be whatever You want me to be I'd go under and all over For your clarity When you wonder If I'm gonna lose my way home Just remember that come whatever I'll be yours all along I've been looking for you baby In every face that I've ever known And there is something about the way you love me That finally feels like home You're my light you're my darkness You're the right kind of madness You're my hope you're my despair You're my scope of everything everywhere The sweetest It's the sweetest Devotion

Gloria, ¡viva la Gloria! Your blast your name In graffiti on the walls Falling through broken glass that's Slashing though your spirit I can hear it like a jilted crowd. Gloria, where are you Gloria? You found a home In all your scars and ammunition You made your bed in salad days Amongst the ruin Ashes to ashes of our youth She mashed her knuckles into winter(Gloria) As autumns wind fades into black She is the saint on all the sinners(Gloria) The one that's fallen through the cracks So don't put away your burning light Don't lose your faith To your lost naivete Weather the storm and don't look Back on last November When your banners were burning down Send me your amnesty down To the broken hearted Bring us the season That we always will remember Don't let the bonfires go out So Gloria Send out your message of the light That shadows in the light.

Green Day,The Forgotten,"Where in the world's the forgotten? They're lost inside your memory You're dragging on, your heart's been broken As we all go down in history Where in the world did the time go? It's where your spirit seems to roam Like losing faith to our abandon Or an empty hallway from a broken home Well don't look away from the arms of a bad dream Don't look away, sometimes you're better lost than to be seen I don't feel strange, it's more like haunted Another moment trapped in time I can't quite put my finger on it But it's like a child that was left behind So, where in the world's the forgotten? Like soldiers from a long lost war We share the scars from our abandon And what we remember becomes folklore Well, don't look away from the arms of a bad dream Don't look away from the arms of a moment Don't look away from the arms of tomorrow Don't look away from the arms of love"

Elton John,I m Gonna Love Me Again,"Oh, the joke was never hard to tell Threw my fair change in the wishing well The dream alone is always in your hands If that don't fill the boy and build the man A heart has many secrets, so I'm told Through the years a theory can grow cold I'm up to be the king, it's gotten clear The voice inside my head is the one I hear Singing I'm gonna love me again Check in on my very best friend Find the wind to fill my sails Rise above the broken rails Unbound by any ties that break or bend I'm free, and don't you know? No clown that claimed he used to know me then And oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again The golden age was somehow bittersweet But now the past lies sleeping in the deep The peaceful days that followed hollow nights A kiss or touch could feel like Kryptonite Praise the saints that hung up on my wall For trust is left in lovers after all A whispered word emerging from a tale My wake up call to claim the cursed spell And I'm gonna love me again Sing I'm gonna love me again And oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again I'm gonna love me again"
Elton John,Don t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,"I can't light no more of your darkness All my pictures seem to fade to black and white I'm growing tired and time stands still before me Frozen here on the ladder of my life Too late to save myself from falling I took a chance and changed your way of life But you misread my meaning when I met you Close the door and left me blind by the light Don't let the sun go down on me Although I search myself it's always someone else I see I'd just allow a fragment of your life To wander free By losing everything is like the sun going down on me I can't find oh the right romantic line But see me once and see the way I feel Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm But these cuts I have oh they need love to help them heal To wander free, yeah"

Elton John,Rocket Man I Think It s Going to Be a Long Long Time,"She packed my bags last night pre-flight Zero hour nine AM And I'm gonna be high As a kite by then I miss the Earth so much I miss my wife It's lonely out in space On such a timeless flight And I think it's gonna be a long long time 'Till touch down brings me round again to find I'm not the man they think I am at home Oh no no no I'm a rocket man Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone Mars ain't the kind of place to raise kids In fact it's cold as hell And there's no one there to raise them If you did And all this science I don't understand It's just my job five days a week A rocket man, a rocket man"
Elton John,Bohemian Rhapsody,"Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?

Elton John,I Guess That s Why They Call It the Blues 1,"Don't wish it away Don't look at it like it's forever Between you and me I could honestly say That things can only get better And while I'm away Dust out the demons inside And it won't be long Before you and me run To the place in our hearts Where we hide And I guess that's why they call it the blues Time on my hands could be time spent with you Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers Rollin' like thunder under the covers Just stare into space Picture my face in your hands Live for each second Without hesitation And never forget I'm your man Wait on me girl Cry in the night if it helps But more than ever I simply love you More than I love life itself Wait on me, girl But more than ever, I simply love you (Laughing like children, living like lovers)"
Elton John,The One,"I saw you dancin' out the ocean Running fast along the sand A spirit born of earth and water Fire flying from your hands In the instant that you love someone In the second that the hammer hits Reality runs up your spine And the pieces finally fit And all I ever needed was the one Like freedom fields where wild horses run When stars collide like you and I No shadows block the sun You're all I've ever needed Babe, you're the one There are caravans we follow Drunken nights in dark hotels When chances breathe between the silence When sex and love no longer gel For each man in his time is Cain Until he walks along the beach And sees his future in the water A long lost heart within his reach Ooh babe, you're the one"
Elton John,Your Song,"It's a little bit funny This feeling inside I'm not one of those who can easily hide I don't have much money, but boy if I did I'd buy a big house where we both could live If I was a sculptor, ha But then again, no Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do My gift is my song, and this one's for you And you can tell everybody This is your song It may be quite simple, but now that it's done I hope you don't mind That I put down in words How wonderful life is while you're in the world I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross But the sun's been quite kind While I wrote this song It's for people like you that keep it turned on So excuse me forgetting But these things I do You see I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue Anyway the thing is, what I really mean Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen That I put down in the words"
Elton John,Goodbye Yellow Brick Road 1,"When are you gonna come down? When are you going to land? I should have stayed on the farm I should have listened to my old man You know you can't hold me forever I didn't sign up with you I'm not a present for your friends to open This boy's too young to be singing the blues, aah So goodbye yellow brick road Where the dogs of society howl You can't plant me in your penthouse I'm going back to my plough Back to the howling old owl in the woods Hunting the horny back toad Oh I've finally decided my future lies Beyond the yellow brick road, aah What do you think you'll do then? That'll shoot down your plane It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics To set you on your feet again But maybe you'll get a replacement There's plenty like me to be found Mongrels, who ain't got a penny Sniffing for tid-bits like you on the ground, aah Well I've finally decided my future lies Beyond the yellow brick road"
Elton John,I Want Love,"I want love, but it's impossible A man like me, so irresponsible A man like me is dead in places Other men feel liberated I can't love, shot full of holes Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold Don't feel nothing, just old scars Toughening up around my heart But I want love, just a different kind I want love, won't break me down Won't brick me up, won't fence me in I want a love, that don't mean a thing That's the love I want, I want love I want love on my own terms After everything I've ever learned Me, I carry too much baggage Oh man I've seen so much traffic So bring it on, I've been bruised Don't give me love that's clean and smooth I'm ready for the rougher stuff No sweet romance, I've had enough I want love, just a different kind I want love won't break me down"
Elton John,I Don t Wanna Go On With You Like That,"I've always said that one's enough to love Now I hear you're braggin' one is not enough Well, somethin' tells me you're not satisfied You got plans to make me one of four or five I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood But you won't catch me carvin' up my love I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit If it takes more than me, let's call it quits 'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that Don't wanna be a feather in your cap I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad But I don't wanna go on with you like that Oh-oh-oh Whoa-oh Oh, yeah It gets so hard sometimes to understand This vicious circle's getting out of hand Don't need an extra eye to see That the fire spreads faster in a breeze And I don't wanna go on with you like that No, I don't wanna go on with you like that One more set of boots on your welcome mat You'll just have to quit 'em if you want me back Oh, if you wanna spread it around, sister, that's just fine But I don't want no second hand feeding me lines If you wanna hold someone in the middle of the night Call out the guards, turn out the light I don't wanna I don't wanna go on with you like that Takin' me back"
Elton John,Sacrifice 1,"It's a human sign When things go wrong When the scent of her lingers And temptation's strong Into the boundary Of each married man Sweet deceit comes calling And negativity lands Cold cold heart Hard done by you Some things look better, baby Just passing through And it's no sacrifice Just a simple word It's two hearts living In two separate worlds But it's no sacrifice No sacrifice It's no sacrifice at all Mutual misunderstanding After the fact Sensitivity builds a prison In the final act We lose direction No stone unturned No tears to damn you When jealousy burns Cold, cold heart Just passin' through It's two hearts livin' But, it's no sacrifice It's no sacrifice, at all No sacrifice, at all"
Elton John,I m Still Standing,"You could never know what it's like Your blood like winter freezes just like ice And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use And did you think this fool could never win Well look at me, I'm coming back again I got a taste of love in a simple way And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid I'm still standing after all this time Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah Once I never could hope to win You starting down the road leaving me again The threats you made were meant to cut me down And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now You know I'm still standing better than I ever did"
Elton John,Crocodile Rock,"I remember when rock was young Me and Suzie had so much fun Holding hands and skimming stones Had an old gold Chevy, and a place of my own But the biggest kick I ever got Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock Well, Crocodile rocking is something shocking When your feet just can't keep still I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will Oh, lady, mama those Friday nights When Suzie wore her dresses tight And the Crocodile rocking was out of sight Laaaaa, la la la la laaaaa, la la la la laaaaa, la la la la laaaaa But the years went by and the rock just died Suzie went and left me for some foreign guy Long nights crying by the record machine Dreaming of my Chevy and old blue jeans But they'll never kill the thrills we've got Burning up to the Crocodile Rock Learning fast as the weeks went past We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last I never knew me a better time and I guess, I never will Crocodile rocking was out of sight Had an old gold Chevy, and place of my own"
Elton John,Stan 2,"Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin' I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom I sent two letters back in autumn You must not've got 'em There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin' Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em But anyways, f- it, what's been up, man?

You said if I'd write you, you would write back See, I'm just like you in a way, I never knew my father neither He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs So when I have a crumby day, I drift away and put 'em on 'Cause I don't really got shit else So that shit helps when I'm depressed I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me See, everything you say is real And I respect you 'cause you tell it My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7 But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up You gotta call me, man I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose, sincerely yours, Stan P.S. We should be together too Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans This'll be the last package I ever send your ass It's been six months, and still no word, I don't deserve it? I know you got my last two letters I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive? You know the song by Phil Collins In the Air of the Night About that guy who could've saved that other guy from drownin' But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him? That's kinda how this is You could've rescued me from drownin' Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall I loved you, Slim, we could've been together Think about it, you ruined it now I hope you go to sleep and you dream about it And when you dream I hope you can't sleep And you scream about it I hope your conscience eats at you And you can't breathe without me See, Slim, shut up, bitch, I'm tryin' to talk Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see, I ain't like you 'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more And then she'll die too Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now Oh shoot, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this tape out? Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that And here's an autograph For your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you But what's this stuff you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that stuff just clownin' dawg Come on, how messed up is you? You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin' To help your ass from bouncin' Off the walls when you get down some And what's this junk about us meant to be together? That type of crap'll make me not want us to meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you But Stan, why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy I seen this one shit on the news A couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk And she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape But they didn't say who it was to Come to think about it, his name was, it was you, damn"

Elton John,Candle in the Wind,Goodbye Norma Jeane Though I never knew you at all You had the grace to hold yourself While those around you crawled They crawled out of the woodwork And they whispered into your brain They set you on the treadmill And they made you change your name And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in And I would've liked to known you But I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did Loneliness was tough The toughest role you ever played Hollywood created a superstar And pain was the price you paid Even when you died Oh the press still hounded you All the papers had to say Was that Marilyn was found in the nude From the young man in the twenty second row Who sees you as something as more than sexual More than just our Marilyn Monroe

Elton John,Can You Feel the Love Tonight 2,There's a calm surrender To the rush of day When the heat of a rolling wind Can be turned away An enchanted moment And it sees me through It's enough for this restless warrior Just to be with you And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer That we got this far And can you feel the love tonight How it's laid to rest?

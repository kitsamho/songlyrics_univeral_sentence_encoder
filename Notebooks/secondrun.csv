Pearl-Jam,Lightning-Bolt-1,"She comes on like a stone But you don't know where from she was thrown Like a burning meteor from miles high Looking for a place to land She said, ""Have you got yourself some sand?"" And whatever you replied, she took as yes Now she comes after thee With her newly planted seeds and soon You're prone down on your knees and there you dig And then before you know the weeds are Obesely overgrown with all the Wild seed she sows in your sleep You gotta know you'll never let her go She's a lightning bolt Lightning bolt Always something and never nothing Isn't that the way we're taught to be, to be? Flipping through the worn out pages And stages when you knew not who to be 'Til the lightning strike sets you free The crashing stormy waves erode her Shoreline everyday until the Castle of her ways turn to sand She holds her lovely breast As the birds fall from the nest Flying towards the great northwest, yeah yeah yeah And with no repair in sight There is no God with such might As to open her world wide with subterfuge Your death will soon arrive As she finally decides that all her Problems, they won't die with you Oh yeah She's your lightning bolt Never let her go She's true She's rock 'n roll Never let go Uncontrollable She's just like you"
Pearl-Jam,Seven-O-Clock,"Seven o'clock in the morning, got a message from afar Down under an oasis where there are dreams still being born And summer spoke to winter relaying all encouraging words And I was fully grateful mutant messages were heard Moved on from my despondency and left it in the bed Do I leave it there still sleeping ot maybe kill it better yet? For this is no time for depression or self-indulgent hesitance This fucked-up situation calls for all hands, hands on deck Freedom is as freedom does and freedom is a verb They giveth they taketh and you fight to keep that what you've earned We saw the destination, got so close before it turned Swim sideways from this undertow And do not be deterred Floodlight dreams go drifting past All the lives we could've had Distant loves floating above Close these eyes, they've seen enough Caught the butterfly, broke its wings then put it on display Stripped of all its beauty once it could not fly high away Still alive like a passer-by overdosed on gamma rays Another God's creation destined to be thrown away Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, they forged the north and west Then there's Sitting Bullshit as our sitting president Talking to his mirror, what's he say, what's it say back? A tragedy of errors, who'll be the last to have a laugh? His best days gone, hard to admit Throwing angry punches with nothing to hit Luminous thoughts were once all he had Fading lights, lost eloquence There's still a fire in the engine room Knows relief will be coming soon What's to be done Carve a path for rivers reign Much to be done Oceans rising with the waves So, held by these thoughts They refuse to slip away Oh, hangman in dreamland About to call your name Much to be"
Pearl-Jam,Alive-1,"Son, she said Have I got a little story for you What you thought was your daddy Was nothin' but a...

Pearl-Jam,Black-1991,"Hey, oh Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay Were laid spread out before me as her body once did All five horizons revolved around her soul As the earth to the sun Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn Oh, and all I taught that was everything Oh, I know she gave me all that she wore And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds Of what was everything? Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything I take a walk outside I'm surrounded by some kids at play I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning How quick the sun can drop away And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass All the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything All the love gone bad, turned my world to black Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all that I'll be, yeah Uh huh, uh huh, oh I know someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star In somebody else's sky, but why, why, why? Can't it be, can't it be mine We belong, we belong together, together!"
Pearl-Jam,Take-The-Long-Way,"You got me through these feelings That separates me from you I put myself through a beating I need you to pull me through I'll break through these feelings I'll break through the ceiling I always take the long way, the long way I always take the long way, that leads me back to you Now's the time to resurface Take back me and you The hammer will fall on purpose Our time, our truth Plant a seed in your mind, what's yours is mine Show me how to live divine, what's yours is mine Back to a moment in your mind, go back in time"
Pearl-Jam,Elderly-Woman-Bahind-the-Counter-in-a-Small-Town,"I seem to recognize your face Haunting, familiar, yet I can't seem to place it Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name Lifetimes are catching up with me All these changes taking place I wish I'd seen the place But no one's ever taken me Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away I swear, I recognize your breath Memories like fingerprints are slowly raising Me, you wouldn't recall for I'm not my former It's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf I changed by not changing at all Small town predicts my fate Perhaps that's what no one wants to see I just want to scream, hello My God, it's been so long Never dreamed you'd return But now here you are and here I am Hearts and thoughts they fade away Hearts and thoughts they fade"
Pearl-Jam,Future-Days,"If I ever were to lose you I'd surely lose myself Everything I have found dear I've not found by myself Try and sometimes you'll succeed To make this man of me All my stolen missing parts I've no need for anymore I believe And I believe cause I can see Our future days Days of you and me Back when I was feeling broken I focused on a prayer You came deep as any ocean Did something out there hear? All the complexities and games No one wins but somehow they're still played All the missing crooked hearts They may die but in us they live on When hurricanes and cyclones raged When winds turned dirt to dust When floods they came or tides they raised Ever closer became us All the promises at sundown I've meant them like the rest All the demons used to come round I'm grateful now they've left So persistent in my ways Hey Angel I am here to stay No resistance, no alarms Please, this is just too good to be gone You and me"
Pearl-Jam,Sirens,"Hear the sirens Hear the circus so profound I hear the sirens More and more in this here town Let me catch my breath to breathe And reach across the bed Just to know we're safe I am a grateful man The slightest bit of light And I can see you clear Have to take your hand And feel your breath For fear this someday will be over I pull you close, so much to lose Knowing that nothing lasts forever I didn't care, before you were here I danced in laughter with the ever after But all things change Let this remain Covering distance in the night The sound echoing closer Will they come for me next time For every choice mistake I've made It's not my plan Or to send you in the arms of Another man And if you choose to stay I'll wait I'll understand It's a fragile thing This life we lead If I think too much I can get Over-whelmed by the grace By which we live our lives With death over our shoulders Want you to know That should I go I always loved you Held you high above, true I study your face And the fear goes away If I think too much I can get over- Whelmed by the grace With death over our shoulder The fear goes away Aah ah, oh oh"
Pearl-Jam,Black-1,"Hey, hey, yeah, uh Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay Were laid spread out before me as her body once did All five horizons revolved around her soul, as the earth to the sun Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn, ooh Ooh, and all I taught her was everything Ooh, I know she gave me all that she wore And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds Of what was everything Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black Tattooed everything I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?

Pearl-Jam,Rearviewmrror,"I took a drive today Time to emancipate I guess it was the beatings made me wise But I'm not about to give thanks, or apologize I couldn't breathe, holdin' me down Hand on my face Pushed to the ground Enmity gaged, united by fear Forced to endure What I could not forgive I seem to look away Wounds in the mirror waved It wasn't my surface most defiled Head at your feet, fool to your crown Pissed on my plate, swallowed it down Enmity gauged, united by fear Tried to endure Saw things Clearer Clearer once you, were in my rearviewmirror I gather speed from you fucking with me Once and for all I'm far away I hardly believe Finally the shades, are raised, hey yeah Saw things so much clearer Once you, once you (rearviewmirror) Once you, oh yeah"
Pearl-Jam,River-Cross,"I always thought I'd cross that river The other side, distant now As I got close it turned and widened Horizon now, fading out Drifting off in the undertow Can't spot a figure on dry land And afterthoughts of safety When in truth, none to be had None to be had I used to tell time by my shadow 'Til the thunderclouds, they took the stage These days will end as do the light's rays Another read of the same page Wide awake through this deepest night Still waiting on the sun As the hours seem to multiply Find a star to soldier on Living beneath a lion's paw Knowing nothing can be tamed Can be tamed I want this dream to last forever A wish denied to lengthen our time I wish this moment was never ending Let it be a lie that all future's die While the government thrives on discontent And there's no such thing as clear Proselytizing and profitizing As our will all but just disappears Folded over, forced in a choke hold Outnumbered and held down And all these talk of rapture Look around at the promise now Here and now Can't hold me down Won't hold us down Live it out Let it out Get it out Shout it out Share the light"
Pearl-Jam,Buckle-Up,I got blood Blood on my hands The stain of Of a human I finally awoke To my mother's wrath Call lights Bed sores and sponge baths Firstly do no harm Then put your seatbelt on Buckle up The drapes pull back Reveal her wound Her boy on her lap A murderer groomed Antiquities lost Lost to the Nile A sudden slip A fall on the time
Pearl-Jam,Jeremy-1,"At home drawing pictures Of mountain tops With him on top Lemon yellow sun Arms raised in a V And the dead lay in pools of maroon below Daddy didn't give attention Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care King Jeremy the wicked Oh, ruled his world Jeremy spoke in class today Clearly I remember Pickin' on the boy Seemed a harmless little fuck But we unleashed the lion Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast How could I forget And he hit me with a surprise left My jaw left hurting Dropped wide open Just like the day Oh, like the day I heard Daddy didn't give affection, no And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear Oh ruled his world Try to forget this (try to forget this) Try to erase this (try to erase this) From the blackboard Jeremy spoke in Spoke in"

You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets, oh Or you can come to terms and realize You're the only one who can't forgive yourself, oh Makes much more sense to live in the present tense Have you ideas on how this life ends?

Here I stand Intense recollections of pain, self-neglecting again Like you, I keep it in Thought you found a game where you could win Yeah, it's all vivisection in the end High or low, try again She fell off the altar A vision you caught of her but then A woodcut in red I wish it was not you that she had led Selfish navigation with no end Where'd you sleep?

Pearl-Jam,Dance-Of-The-Clairvoyants,"Confusion is to commotion What love is to our devotion Imperceptibly big, big as the ocean And equally hard to control So save your predictions And burn your assumptions Love is friction Ripe for comfort Endless equations And tugging persuasions Doors open up To interpretation Expecting perfection Leaves a lot to ignore When the past is the present And the future's no more When every tomorrow Is the same as before The looser things get The tighter you become Tighter Not one man Can be greater than the sum That's not a negative thought I'm positive, positive, positive Falling down, not staying down Could'a held me up Rather than tearing me down Drown in the river Leaves a lot to endure Numbers keep falling off the calendar's floor We're stuck in our boxes Windows open no more Couldn't lift up the forget-me-nots Not recalling what they're for I'm in love with clairvoyants 'Cause they're out of this world I know the girls wanna dance Fall away their circumstance I know the boys wanna grow Their dicks and fix and file things Clairvoyants in a trance Stand back when the spirit comes Stand back Away their circumstance"

Pearl-Jam,Laughter,"Alone, listless Breakfast table in an otherwise empty room Young girl, violence Center of her own attention The mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it Tries to make her proud The shades go down, it's in her head Painted room, can't deny there's something wrong Don't call me daughter, not fit to The picture kept will remind me Don't call me She holds the hand that holds her down She will rise above Don't call me daughter, not fit to me (The shades go down) (The shades go, go) (Go)"

Pearl-Jam,Superblood-Wolfmoon,"Superblood wolfmoon Took her away too soon I can hear you singin' in the distance I can see you when I close my eyes Once you were somewhere and now you're everywhere I'm feeling selfish and I want what's right I ask for forgiveness I beg of myself Feeling every night that I see Right now I feel a lack of innocence Searchin' for reveal hypnotonic residence I feel not much of anything And the cause is life or death A life of hopelessness, focus on you focusness I've been hopin' and I hope that lasts I don't know anything, I question everything This life I love is going way too fast Both my eyes are swollen, my face is broken And I'm hope that I hurt you Hope that I hurt you She was a stunner and I am stunned And the first thought or second thought ""could be the one"" I was a prisoner of keys and the cuffs Yeah, I was feeling fortunate to be locked up But the world got to spinnin' Always felt like it was endin' And love right, it was standin' We are each of us Feelin' angry Now, get off the stage Focus on you focusness, turn around for hopelessness I've been hopin' and all hope was lost"
Pearl-Jam,World-Wide-Suicide-1,"I felt the earth on Monday It moved beneath my feet In the form of a morning paper Laid out for me to see Saw his face in a corner picture I recognized the name Could not stop staring at the Face I'd never see again It's a shame to awake in a world of pain What does it mean when a war has taken over? It's the same every day I heard my name What can be saved and who will be left to hold her? The whole world World over It's a world wide suicide Medals on a wooden mantle Next to a handsome face That the president took for granted Writing checks the whole world pays And in all the madness Thought becomes numb and naive Too much to talk about and Nothing for to say It's the same every day And the wave won't break Tell you to pray while The devil's on his shoulder Laying claim to the take That our soldiers save Does not equate, and The truth's already out there Looking in the eyes of the fallen You've got to know there's another Another, another, another, another Way What does it mean when the war has taken over It's the same every day and the wave won't break Tell you to pray while the devil's on his shoulder"

Bon-Jovi,These-Days,"I was walking around, just a face in the crowd Trying to keep myself out of the rain Saw a vagabond king wear a Styrofoam crown Wondered if I might end up the same There's a man out on the corner Singing old songs about change Everybody's got their cross to bear, these days She came looking for some shelter With a suitcase full of dreams To a motel room on the boulevard I guess she's trying to be James Dean She's seen all the disciples and all the wanna be's No one wants to be themselves these days Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days These days the stars seem out of reach These days there ain't a ladder on the streets Oh no, no, no These days are fast, nothing lasts in this graceless age There ain't nobody left but us these days Jimmy shoes busted both his legs, trying to learn to fly From a second story window, he just jumped and closed his eyes His momma said he was crazy, he said ""Momma, I've got to try Don't you know that all my heroes died And I guess, I'd rather die than fa, fa, fade away, yeah"" These days the stars ain't out of reach, yeah But these days there ain't a ladder on the streets These days are fast, love don't lasts in this graceless age Even innocence has caught the midnight train And there ain't nobody left but us these days I know Rome's still burning Though the times have changed This world kept turning round, and round, and round, and round These days These days the stars seem out of reach, yeah But these days there ain't a ladder on these streets These days are fast, nothing lasts There ain't no time to waste There ain't nobody left to take the blame Ain't nobody left but us these days"

Black-Sabbath,Zeitgeist,Astral engines in reverse I'm falling through the universe again Down among a dead mans vision Faded dreams and nuclear fishions span The strings of fear they are holding up the race The puppets falling to the ground The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found On this sinking ship I travel Faster than the speed of life Not so super nova burns The black holes turn and fade from sight The strings of fear they hide within the human race The answers burried underground And very soon The boundless moon Will show us light And as we crash We'll pray and kiss And say goodnight Goodnight

Black-Sabbath,Warning,"Now the first day that I met you I was looking in the sky When the sun turned all a blur And the thunderclouds rolled by The sea began to shiver And the wind began to moan It must've been a sign for me To leave you well alone I was born without you, baby But my feelings were a little bit too strong You never said you love me And I don't believe you can 'Cause I saw you in a dream And you were with another man You looked so cool and casual And I tried to look the same But now, I've got to love you Tell me who am I to blame?

Black-Sabbath,Turn-Up-the-Night,"A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell. No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well. The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul. You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told. So get a good hold, yeah. Regiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are. A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far. A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know. So let it all go! Turn up the night! It feels so right! Night-time sorrow, taken like a pain. Black will not become a white, it's all the same. Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark. Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn! Get out of light! If it feels right, Shut off the light!"

Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me He said, ""Son, son, you've gone too far 'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do"" Yeah!"
Black-Sabbath,Wheels-of-Confusion,"Long ago I wandered through my mind In the land of fairy tales and stories Lost in happiness I knew no fears Innocence and love was all I knew Was it illusion? Soon the days went passing into years Happiness just didn't come so easy Life was born of fairy tales and daydreams Innocence was just another word Lost in the wheels of confusion Running through furnace of tears Eyes full of angered illusion Hiding in every daydream So I found that life is just a game But you know there's never been a winner Try your hardest, just to be a loser The world will still be turning when you're gone Yeah when you're gone!"
Black-Sabbath,Sabbath-Bloody-Sabbath,"You see life through distorted eyes You know you have to learn The execution of your mind You really have to turn The race is run, the book is read The end begins to show The truth is out, the lies are old But you don't want to know Nobody will ever let you know When you ask the reasons why They just tell you that you're on your own Fill your head all full of lies The people who have crippled you You want to see them burn The gates of life have closed on you And there's just no return You're wishing that the hands of doom Could take your mind away And you don't care if you don't see again The light of day You bastards Where can you run to What more can you do No more tomorrow Life is killing you Dreams turn to nightmares Heaven turns to hell Burned out confusion Nothing more to tell, yeah Everything around you What's it coming to God knows as your dog knows Bog blast all of you Sabbath, bloody sabbath Nothing more to do Living just for dying Dying just for you, yeah"

Black-Sabbath,Loner,He's just a loner. He never says hello. A friend to no one. He's got no place to go. He don't look happy. He looks through furtive eyes. He ain't got nothing. No one to sympathize. He hides himself away. His secrets not revealed. As life just passes by He keeps himself concealed. A solitary man. An enigmatic child. A riddle never solved. A prisoner exiled. I wonder if the loner can assimilate. A life less lived alone plays devil's advocate. Has he ever tried to be happy? Reached out from inside. Someone on who he can depend. It's getting too late to recover. He won't stand a chance And into his own hell he'll descend. Don't descend. No understanding Of things we already know. He has to live his life And just learn how to let go. Communication's an impossibility. His own best friend but he's his own worst enemy. The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head. I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead. Come on you!
Black-Sabbath,Neon-Knights,"Oh no, here it comes again Can't remember when we came so close to love before Hold on, good things never last Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again Again and again, again and again, again Cry out, to legions of the brave Time again to save us from the jackals of the street Ride out, protectors of the realm Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights Circles and rings, dragons and kings Weaving a charm and a spell Blessed by the night, holy and bright Called by the toll of the bell Bloodied angels fast descending Moving on a never-bending light Phantom figures free forever Out of shadows, shining ever-bright Neon Knights All right Again and again, again and again and again"

Black-Sabbath,God-Is-Dead,"Lost in the darkness I fade from the light Faith of my father, my brother, my maker and savior Help me make it through the night Blood on my conscience And murder in mind Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb into impending doom Now my body is my shrine The blood runs free The rain turns red Give me the wine, you keep the bread The voices echo in my head Is God alive or is God dead? Is God dead? Rivers of evil Run through dying land Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal and borrow There is no tomorrow For the sinners will be damned Ashes to ashes You cannot exhume a soul Who do you trust when corruption and lust, creed of all the unjust Leaves you empty and unwhole When will this nightmare be over? Tell me! When can I empty my head? Will someone tell me the answer? Is God really dead? To safeguard my philosophy Until my dying breath I transfer from reality Into a living dead I empathize with enemies until the timing's right With God and Satan at my side From darkness will come light I watch the rain as it turns red Give me more wine I don't need bread These riddles that live in my head I don't believe that God is dead! God is dead? Nowhere to run Nowhere to hide Wondering if we will meet again on the other side Do you believe a word What the good book says Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead? God is dead! Right! But still the voices in my head Are telling me that God is dead The blood pours down I don't believe that God is dead"
Judas-Priest,The-Green-Manalishi-With-the-Two-Pronged-Crown,"Now when the day goes to sleep and the full moon lurks And the night is so black that the darkness cooks And you come creeping around Making me do things I don't want to do I can't believe that she needs my love so bad You come sneaking around trying to drive me mad Busting in all my dreams Making me see things I don't want to see 'Cause you're the Green Manalishi With the two-pronged crown All night dragging us up Or you're bringing us down Just taking my love, and slip away Leaving me here trying to keep from following you"
Judas-Priest,Breaking-the-Law,"There I was completely wasting, out of work and down All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die So I might as well begin to put some action in my life Breaking the law, breaking the law So much for the golden future, I can't even start I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too You don't know what it's like"
Judas-Priest,Before-the-Dawn,"Before the dawn, I hear you whisper In your sleep ""Don't let the morning take him"" Outside the birds begin to call As if to summon up my leaving It's been a lifetime since I found someone Since I found someone who would stay I've waited too long, and now you're leaving Oh please don't take it all away"

Judas-Priest,Night-Crawler,Howling winds keep screaming 'round And the rain comes pouring down Doors are locked and bolted now As the thing crawls into town Straight out of hell One of a kind Stalking his victim Don't look behind you Night crawler Beware the beast in black You know he's coming back Sanctuary is being sought Whispered prayers our last resort Homing in its cry distorts Terror struck they know they're caught As night is falling The end is drawing near They'll hear Their last rites echo on the wind Huddled in the cellar Fear caught in their eyes Daring not to move or breathe As the creature cries Fingernails start scratching On the outside wall Clawing at the windows Come to me it calls Atmosphere's electric As it now descends the stairs Hiding in the darkness Is so futile from its glare Death comes in an instant As they hoped it would Souls ascend to heaven While it feasts on flesh and blood Beware the beast is black He's gonna get you Beware of the beast

Exhumed,Necromaniac,"Awakened by an unquenchable addiction To walk hand in hand with death Exhumed to transcend the walls of the coffin And search for newly rotted flesh Casket crushing and dismantling the grave With other fiends in this sadistic enclave On draughts of blood my thirst is slaked Underfoot the mouldy bones break Nocturnal devestation my only aim Dead or living I seek out and maim Six feet is the depth of my obsession Adding masterpieces to my morbid collection Corpses lay ripped limb from limb in disarray A cadaveric splatter platter carved, hacked and flayed Imbibing blood and alcohol 'til vomit flows red Then back to the grave for indignities to the dead Necromaniac The naked and the dead gore whore slashed Opened her torso after plundering her gash, A bone fucking Pus grinding necromaniac Assaulting the dead with this fucking gore attack In the name of gore I violate the deceased Rest assured that you will never rest in Peace The dust in the mausoleum will never settle From the relentless pounding of gore fucking metal"
Exhumed,Under-the-Knife,"Scalpels cleave and reave though crimson rivulets Weaving their cold and malignant minuets Carving out funereal figures in arcane alphabets Scars that will never heal or forget Like puzzle pieces, set askew, you've come undone The bleeding is ceaseless, you're turning blue, the end had begun Set down in writing, flesh, blood and bone, let death be done The pen is as mighty as the sword, sticks or stones, your end would be cast In stone, by either one Tenderly thanatographical threads are tread and traced Boiling blood will serve to warm this cold clinical embrace A clean precise cut to mark this morbid meeting place This knife, point where you and death came face to face The slab starts to spin around and around, as I take your hand in mine We move step by step within, without so much as a sound, death's dark design In time A slice to the left, then cut back to the right, movements scripted in this Dance of the dead Motions so deft, recalled by touch not by sight, footprints encrypted by Blood running red A pirouette on razor's edge leaves you breathless The slab plays host to an incisive macabre ballet A savage, slicing slaughter of the senses Now splayed Under the knife, your death hangs in the balance, on the edge of the blade Remember every slice l, of this jigsawed demise, and every part that I payed Cold steel burns like ice, leaves you dancing on nothing, loosed by Unsteady hands Under the knife, the caress of steel, just before the end Just before the end A bleeding patchwork design, in running scarlet writ Connected wounds intersecting from slit to bloody slit Such a tangled web of shreds and scars I've knit The liquid of life, leaks out through the red at your wrists May I have this last dance? As I take your last breath With a final flick of my wrist Remember every slice, of this jigsawed demise, and every part that I payed"
Exhumed,Rabid,"Infection spreads like wildfire Mouths begin to form Hydrophobic epidemic Spurs a lust for blood and bone Feral instincts awakened Devolved to savagery Preying upon each other In deranged ecstasy Salivating thirst - drink your blood Your arteries they'll burst - rabid A hunger slaked by flesh - eat your skin Thralls enslaved by death - rabid Death can come in many forms Closing in around you fast Scream in horror as your neighbors Are the ones who will make you breathe your last Primitive urges You once thought had been tamed Now rise to the surface To hack, rend and maim"
Exhumed,In-the-Mouth-of-Hell,"Locked within a padded cell, home for the deranged Condemned within these horrid walls, totally insane The fear within you starts to build, creeping up your spine Gaze on the unspeakable, forever lose your mind Terror chills your flesh Thoughts of gruesome death In the mouth of hell No one hears your death knell Terror-stricken, try to run, there is no escape Forbidden sights made of flesh, mind and soul are raped From beyond they arise, on sanity they feed Blood spurts from behind your eyes, fall onto your knees Slither through the walls Hear the darkness call Asylum lost to lunacy, walls painted red with death Portal to another world, far beyond the flesh You wander ever downward, not to be seen again Lost in darkened corridors - now you're one of them!"
